<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The present volume is issued in compliance with the strong
solicitations of many, to whose desire deference was due.
In selecting the articles, I have been guided mainly by two
considerations,&ndash;&ndash;namely, the necessity for reproducing the
mature opinion of a great mind, upon great subjects; and
for making the selection so varied, as to convey to the
reader some idea of the wonderful versatility of the powers
which could treat subjects so diverse in their nature with
such uniform eloquence and discrimination. I trust that
the chapters on Education will prove to be a valuable contribution
to the speedy settlement of that question at the
present crisis. Those on Sutherlandshire are inserted
because they possess a permanent value, in connection
with the social and economical history of our country.
Some of the articles are of a personal character, and
are introduced, not, certainly, for the purpose of recalling
old animosities, but solely to illustrate the author&#8217;s
method of using some of the more formidable figures
of speech; while over against these may be set some on
purely literary subjects, which show the genial tenderness
of his disposition towards those who aspired to serve God
and their generation by giving to the world the fruit of
their imagination, their labour, and their leisure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_vi' name='page_vi'></a>vi</span></p>
<p>I have not determined the selection without securing the
counsel and approval of men on whose judgment I could
rely. It only remains for me to thank them, and in an
especial way to thank Mr. D. O. Hill for the portrait
which forms the frontispiece. An impersonal reference to
a similar portrait taken at the same time will be found at
page 184, in the article on &#8216;The Calotype.&#8217;</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE<br />TO<br />THOUGHTS ON THE EDUCATIONAL QUESTION.</h2>
</div>
<p>The following chapters on the Educational Question first
appeared as a series of articles in the <i>Witness</i> newspaper.
They present, in consequence, a certain amount of digression,
and occasional re-statement and explanation, which,
had they been published simultaneously, as parts of a whole,
they would not have exhibited. The controversy was vital
and active at every stage of their appearance. Statements
made and principles laid down in the earlier articles had,
from the circumstance that their truth had been questioned
or their soundness challenged, to be re-asserted and maintained
in those which followed; and hence some little
derangement in the management of the question, for which,
however, the interest which must always attach to a real
conflict may be found to compensate. That portion of the
controversy, however, which arose out of one of the articles
of the series, and which some have deemed personal, has
been struck out of the published edition of the pamphlet,
and retained in but an inconsiderable number of copies,
placed in the hands of a few friends. In omitting it where
it has been omitted, the writer has acted on the advice of
a gentleman for whose judgment he entertains the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
thorough respect, and from a desire that the general argument
should not be prejudiced by a matter naturally, but
not necessarily, connected with it. And in retaining it
where it has been retained, he has done so in the full expectation
of a time not very distant, when it will be decided
that he has neither outraged the ordinary courtesies of controversy,
nor taken up a false line of inference or statement;
and when the importance of the subject discussed will be
regarded as quite considerable enough to make any one
earnest, without the necessity of supposing that he had been
previously angry.</p>
<p>It is all-important, that on the general question of
National Education, the Free Church should take up her
position wisely. Majorities in her courts, however overwhelming,
will little avail her, if their findings fail to recommend
themselves to the good sense of her people, or are
palpably unsuited to the emergencies of the time. A
powerful writer of the present age employs, in one of his
illustrations, the bold figure of a ship&#8217;s crew, that, with the
difficulties of Cape Horn full before them, content themselves
with instituting aboard their vessel a constitutional
system of voting, and who find delight in contemplating the
unanimity which prevails on matters in general, both above
decks and below. &#8216;But your ship,&#8217; says Carlyle, &#8216;cannot
double Cape Horn by its excellent plans of voting: the
ship, to get round Cape Horn, will find a set of conditions
already voted for, and fixed with adamantine rigour, by the
ancient Elemental Powers, who are entirely careless how
you vote. If you can by voting, or without voting, ascertain
these conditions, and valiantly conform to them, you
will get round the Cape: if you cannot, the ruffian Winds
will blow you ever back again; the inexorable Icebergs,
dumb privy councillors from Chaos, will nudge you with
most chaotic admonition; you will be flung half-frozen on
the Patagonian cliffs, or jostled into shivers by your iceberg
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
councillors, and will never get round Cape Horn at all.&#8217;
Now there is much meaning couched in this quaint figure,
and meaning which the Free Church would do well to
ponder. There are many questions on which she could
perhaps secure a majority, which yet that majority would
utterly fail to carry. On the question of College Extension,
for instance, she might be able to vote, if she but selected
her elders with some little care, that there should be full
staffs of theological professors at Glasgow and Aberdeen.
But what would her votes succeed in achieving? Not,
assuredly, the doubling of the Cape; but the certainty of
shivering her all-important Educational Institute on three
inexorable icebergs. In the first place, her magnificent
metropolitan College, like that huge long boat, famous in
story, which Robinson Crusoe was able to build, but wholly
unable to launch, would change from being what it now is&ndash;&ndash;a
trophy of her liberality and wisdom&ndash;&ndash;into a magnificent
monument of her folly. In the second place, she would
have to break faith with her existing professors, and to
argue, mayhap, when they were becoming thin and seedy,
and getting into debt, that she was not morally bound to
them for their salaries. And, in the third and last place,
she would infallibly secure that, some twenty years hence
at furthest, every theological professor of the Free Church
should be a pluralist, and able to give to his lectures merely
those fag-ends of his time which he could snatch from the
duties of the pulpit and the care of his flock. And such,
in doubling the Cape Horn of the College question, is all
that unanimity of voting could secure to the Church;
unless, indeed, according to Carlyle, she voted in accordance
with the &#8216;set of conditions already voted for and fixed
by the adamantine powers.&#8217;</p>
<p>Nor does the question of Denominational Education,
now that there is a national scheme in the field, furnish a
more, but, on the contrary, a much less, hopeful subject for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
mere voting in our church courts, than the question of
College Extension. It is <i>not</i> to be carried by ecclesiastical
majorities. Some of the most important facts in the &#8216;Ten
Years&#8217; Conflict&#8217; have perhaps still to be recorded; and it is
one of these, that long after the Non-Intrusion party possessed
majorities in the General Assembly, the laity looked
on with exceedingly little interest, much possessed by the
suspicion that the clergy were battling, not on the popular
behalf, but on their own. Even in 1839, after the Auchterarder
case had been decided in the House of Lords, the
apathy seemed little disturbed; and the writer of these
chapters, when engaged in doing his little all to dissipate it,
could address a friend in Edinburgh, to whom he forwarded
the MS. of a pamphlet thrown into the form of a letter to
Lord Brougham, in the following terms:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;The question
which at present agitates the Church is a vital one; and
unless the people can be roused to take part in it (and they
seem strangely uninformed and wofully indifferent as yet),
the worst cause must inevitably prevail. They may perhaps
listen to one of their own body, who combines the
principles of the old with the opinions of the modern Whig,
and who, though he feels strongly on the question, has no
secular interest involved in it.&#8217; It was about this time that
Dr. George Cook said&ndash;&ndash;and, we have no doubt, said truly&ndash;&ndash;that
he could scarce enter an inn or a stage-coach without
finding respectable men inveighing against the utter folly of
the Non-Intrusionists, and the worse than madness of the
church courts. For the opponents of the party were all
active and awake at the time, and its incipient friends still
indifferent or mistrustful. The history of Church petitions
in Edinburgh during the ten eventful years of the war brings
out this fact very significantly in the statistical form. From
1833, the year of the Veto Act, to 1839, the year of the
Auchterarder decision, petitions to Parliament from Edinburgh
on behalf of the struggling Church were usually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
signed by not more than from four to five thousand persons.
In 1839 the number rose to six thousand. The people
began gradually to awaken, and to trust. Speeches in
church courts were found to have comparatively little
influence in creating opinion, or ecclesiastical votes in
securing confidence; and so there were other means of
appealing to the public mind resorted to, mayhap not
wholly without effect: for in 1840 the annual Church petition
from Edinburgh bore attached to it thirteen thousand
signatures; and to that of the following year (1841) the
very extraordinary number of twenty-five thousand was appended.
And, save for the result, general over Scotland,
which we find thus indicated by the Church petitions of
Edinburgh, the Disruption, and especially the origination
of a Free Church, would have been impossible events.
How, we ask, was that result produced? Not, certainly,
by the votes of ecclesiastical courts,&ndash;&ndash;for mere votes
would never have doubled the Cape Horn of the Church
question; but simply through the conviction at length
effectually wrought in the public mind, that our ministers
were struggling and suffering, not for clerical privileges, but
for popular rights,&ndash;&ndash;not for themselves, but for others.
And that conviction once firmly entertained, the movement
waxed formidable; for elsewhere, as in the metropolis,
popular support increased at least fivefold; and the question,
previously narrow of base, and very much restricted to
one order of men, became broad as the Scottish nation, and
deep as the feelings of the Scottish people. But as certainly
as the component strands of a cable that have been twisted
into strength and coherency by one series of workings,
may be untwisted into loose and feeble threads by another,
so certainly may the majorities of our church courts, by
a reversal of the charm which won for them the element
of popular strength, render themselves of small account
in the nation. They became strong by advocating, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
Patronage question, popular rights, in opposition to clerical
interests: they may and will become weak, if in the Educational
one they reverse the process, and advocate clerical
interests in opposition to popular rights.</p>
<p>Their country is perishing for lack of a knowledge which
they cannot supply. Every seven years&ndash;&ndash;the brief term
during which, if a generation fail to be educated, the opportunity
of education for ever passes away&ndash;&ndash;there are from a
hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand of the youth of
Scotland added to the adult community in an untaught,
uninformed condition. Nor need we say in how frightful a
ratio their numbers must increase. The ignorant children
of the present will become the improvident and careless
parents of the future; and how improvident and careless
the corresponding class which already exists among us
always approves itself to be, let our prisons and workhouses
tell. Our country, with all its churches, must inevitably
founder among the nations, like a water-logged vessel in a
tempest, if this state of matters be permitted to continue.
And why permit it to continue? Be it remembered that
it is the <i>national</i> schools&ndash;&ndash;those schools which are the
people&#8217;s own, and are yet withheld from them&ndash;&ndash;and not the
schools of the Free Church, which it is the object of the
Educational movement to open up and extend. Nor is it
proposed to open them up on a new principle. It is an
unchallenged fact, that there exists no statutory provision
for the teaching of religion <i>in them</i>. All that is really
wanted is, to transfer them on their present statutory basis
from the few to the many,&ndash;&ndash;from Moderate ministers and
Episcopalian heritors, to a people essentially sound in the
faith&ndash;&ndash;Presbyterian in the proportion of at least <i>six</i> to one,
and Evangelical in the proportion of at least <i>two</i> to one.
And at no distant day this transference must and will take
place, if the ministers of the Free Church do not virtually
join their forces to their brethren of the Establishment in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
behalf of an alleged ecclesiastical privilege nowhere sanctioned
in the word of God.<a name='FNanchor_m017_1' id='FNanchor_m017_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_m017_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a></p>
<p>There is another important item in this question, over
which, as already determined by inevitable laws, ecclesiastical
votes, however unanimous, can exert no influence or
control. They cannot ordain that inadequately paid schoolmasters
can be other than inferior educators. If the remuneration
be low, it is impossible by any mere force of
majorities to render the teaching high. There is a law
already &#8216;voted for&#8217; in the case, which majorities can no
more repeal than they can the law of gravitation. And
here we must take the opportunity of stating&ndash;&ndash;for there
has been misrepresentation on the point&ndash;&ndash;what our interest
in the teachers of Scotland and of the Free Church
really is. Certainly not indifferent to their comfort as men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
or to the welfare of their profession, as one of the most
important and yet worst remunerated in the community,
we frankly confess that we look to something greatly higher
than either their comfort or the professional welfare in
general. They and their profession are but <i>means</i>; and it
is to the <i>end</i> that we mainly look,&ndash;&ndash;that end being the right
education of the Scottish people, and their consequent
elevation in the scale, moral and intellectual. We would
deal by the teachers of the country in this matter as we
would by the stone-cutters of Edinburgh, were we entrusted
with the erection of some such exquisite piece of masonry
as the Scott Monument, or that fine building recently completed
in St. Andrew Square. Instead of pitching our
scale of remuneration at the rate of labourers&#8217; wages, we
would at once pitch it at the highest rate assigned to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
skilled mechanic; and this not in order, primarily at least,
that the masons engaged should be comfortable, but in
order that they should be masters of their profession, and
that their work should be of the completest and most
finished kind. For labourers&#8217; wages would secure the
services of only bungling workmen, and lead to the production
of only inferior masonry. And such is the principle
on which we would befriend our poor schoolmasters,&ndash;&ndash;not
so much for their own sakes, as for the sake of their work.
Further, however, it is surely of importance that, when
engaged in teaching religion, they themselves should be
enabled, in conformity with one of its injunctions, to &#8216;provide
things honest in the sight of all men.&#8217; Nay, of nothing
are we more certain, than that the Church has only to
exert herself to the extent of the liabilities already incurred
to her teachers, in order to be convinced of the absolute
necessity which exists for a broad national scheme. Any
doubts which she may at present entertain regarding the
question of the <i>necessity</i>, are, in part at least, effects of her
lax views respecting the question of the <i>liability</i>, and of her
consequent belief that <i>anything well divided</i> is sufficient to
discharge it. At the same time, however, it would be
perhaps well that at least our better-paid schoolmasters
should be made to reflect that the circumstances of their
position are very peculiar; and that should they take a
zealous part against what a preponderating majority of the
laity of their Church must of necessity come to regard as
the cause of their country, their opposition, though utterly
uninfluential in the general struggle, may prove thoroughly
effectual in injuring themselves. For virtually in the Free
Church, as in the British Constitution, it is the &#8216;<i>Commons</i>&#8217;
who grant the supplies.</p>
<p>We subjoin the paper on the Educational Question,
addressed by Dr. Chalmers to the Hon. Mr. Fox Maule,
as it first appeared in the <i>Witness</i>. The reader will see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
that there is direct reference made to it in the following
pages, and will find it better suited to repay careful study
and frequent perusal than perhaps any other document on
the subject ever written:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;It were the best state of things, that we had a Parliament
sufficiently theological to discriminate between the
right and the wrong in religion, and to encourage or endow
accordingly. But failing this, it seems to us the next best
thing, that in any public measure for helping on the education
of the people, Government were to abstain from introducing
the element of religion at all into their part of the
scheme; and this not because they held the matter to be
insignificant,&ndash;&ndash;the contrary might be strongly expressed in
the preamble of their Act,&ndash;&ndash;but on the ground that, in the
present divided state of the Christian world, they would
take no cognizance of, just because they would attempt no
control over, the religion of applicants for aid,&ndash;&ndash;leaving
this matter entire to the parties who had to do with the
erection and management of the schools which they had
been called upon to assist. A grant by the State upon this
footing might be regarded as being appropriately and exclusively
the expression of their value for a good secular
education.</p>
<p>&#8216;The confinement for the time being of any Government
measure for schools to this object we hold to be an imputation,
not so much on the present state of our Legislature,
as on the present state of the Christian world, now broken
up into sects and parties innumerable, and seemingly incapable
of any effort for so healing these wretched divisions
as to present the rulers of our country with aught like such
a clear and unequivocal majority in favour of what is good
and true, as might at once determine them to fix upon and
to espouse it.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is this which has encompassed the Government with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
difficulties, from which we can see no other method of extrication
than the one which we have ventured to suggest.
And as there seems no reason why, because of these unresolved
differences, a public measure for the health of all&ndash;&ndash;for
the recreation of all&ndash;&ndash;for the economic advancement
of all&ndash;&ndash;should be held in abeyance, there seems as little
reason why, because of these differences, a public measure
for raising the general intelligence of all should be held in
abeyance. Let the men therefore of all Churches and all
denominations alike hail such a measure, whether as carried
into effect by a good education in letters or in any of the
sciences; and, meanwhile, in these very seminaries let that
education in religion which the Legislature abstains from
providing for, be provided for as freely and as amply as they
will by those who have undertaken the charge of them.</p>
<p>&#8216;We should hope, as the result of such a scheme, for a
most wholesome rivalship on the part of many in the great
aim of rearing on the basis of their respective systems a
moral and Christian population, well taught in the principles
and doctrines of the gospel, along with being well taught in
the lessons of ordinary scholarship. Although no attempt
should be made to regulate or to enforce the lessons of
religion in the inner hall of legislation, this will not prevent,
but rather stimulate, to a greater earnestness in the contest
between truth and falsehood&ndash;&ndash;between light and darkness&ndash;&ndash;in
the outer field of society; nor will the result of such
a contest in favour of what is right and good be at all the
more unlikely, that the families of the land have been raised
by the helping hand of the State to a higher platform than
before, whether as respects their health, or their physical
comfort, or their economic condition, or, last of all, their
place in the scale of intelligence and learning.</p>
<p>&#8216;Religion would, under such a system, be the immediate
product, not of legislation, but of the Christian philanthropic
zeal which obtained throughout society at large.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
But it is well when what legislation does for the fulfilment
of its object tends not to the impediment, but rather, we
apprehend, to the furtherance, of those greater and higher
objects which are in the contemplation of those whose
desires are chiefly set on the immortal wellbeing of man.</p>
<p>&#8216;On the basis of these general views, I have two remarks
to offer regarding the Government scheme of education.</p>
<p>&#8216;1. I should not require a certificate of satisfaction with
the religious progress of the scholars from the managers of
the schools, in order to their receiving the Government
aid. Such a certificate from Unitarians or Catholics implies
the direct sanction or countenance by Government to
their respective creeds, and the responsibility, not of <i>allowing</i>,
but, more than this, of <i>requiring</i>, that these shall be
taught to the children who attend. A bare allowance is
but a general toleration; but a requirement involves in it
all the mischief, and, I would add, the guilt, of an indiscriminate
endowment for truth and error.</p>
<p>&#8216;2. I would suffer parents or natural guardians to select
what parts of the education they wanted for their children.
I would not force arithmetic upon them, if all they wanted
was reading and writing; and as little would I force the
Catechism, or any part of the religious instruction that was
given in the school, if all they wanted was a secular education.
That the managers of the Church of England schools
shall have the power to impose their own Catechism upon
the children of Dissenters, and, still more, to compel their
attendance on church, I regard as among the worst parts
of the scheme.</p>
<p>&#8216;The above observations, it will be seen, meet any questions
which might be put in regard to the applicability of
the scheme to Scotland, or in regard to the use of the
Douay version in Roman Catholic schools.</p>
<p>&#8216;I cannot conclude without expressing my despair of
any great or general good being effected in the way of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Christianizing our population, but through the medium of
a Government themselves Christian, and endowing the true
religion, which I hold to be their imperative duty, not
because it is the religion of the many, but because it is
true.</p>
<p>&#8216;The scheme on which I have now ventured to offer
these few observations I should like to be adopted, not
because it is absolutely the best, but only the best in existing
circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8216;The endowment of the Catholic religion by the State I
should deprecate, as being ruinous to the country in all its
interests. Still I do not look for the general Christianity of
the people, but through the medium of the Christianity of
their rulers. This is a lesson taught <i>historically</i> in Scripture,
by what we read there of the influence which the
personal character of the Jewish monarchs had on the moral
and religious state of their subjects; it is taught <i>experimentally</i>,
by the impotence, now fully established, of the
Voluntary principle; and last, and most decisive of all, it
is taught <i>prophetically</i> in the book of Revelation, when
told that then will the kingdoms of the earth (<i>Basileiai</i>,
or governing powers) become the kingdoms of our Lord
Jesus Christ, or the Governments of the earth become
Christian Governments.</p>

<span style="font-size:0.8em">ON</span><br />
THE EDUCATIONAL QUESTION.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER FIRST.</h3>
<p class="ch_summary" >Disputes regarding the meaning embodied by Chalmers in his Educational Document&ndash;&ndash;Narrative
suited to throw some light on the subject&ndash;&ndash;Consideration of the
Document itself&ndash;&ndash;Testimony respecting it of the Hon. Mr. Fox Maule.</p>
<p>One of the most important controversies which has arisen
within the pale of the Romish Church&ndash;&ndash;that between the
Jansenists and Jesuits&ndash;&ndash;was made to hinge for many years
on a case of disputed meaning in the writings of a certain
deceased author. There were five doctrines of a well-defined
character which, the Jesuits said, were to be found
in the works of Cornelius Jansenius, umquhile Bishop of
Ypres, but which, the Jansenists asserted, were not to be
found in anything Jansenius had ever written. And in the
attempt to decide this simple question of fact, as Pascal
calls it, the School of the Sorbonne and the Court of the
Inquisition were completely baffled; and zealous Roman
Catholics heard without conviction the verdict of councils,
and failed to acquiesce in the judgment of even the Pope.</p>
<p>We have been reminded oftener than once of this singular
controversy, by the late discussions which have arisen
in our church courts regarding the meaning embodied by
Chalmers in that posthumous document on the Educational
question, which is destined, we hold, to settle the whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
controversy. At first we regarded it as matter of wonder
that such discussions should have arisen; for we had held
that there was really little room for difference respecting
the meaning of Chalmers,&ndash;&ndash;a man whose nature it was to
deal with broad truths, not with little distinctions; and
who had always the will, and certainly did not lack the
ability, of making himself thoroughly understood. We
have since thought, however, that as there is nothing
which has once occurred that may not occur again, what
happened to the writings of Jansenius might well happen
to one of the writings of Chalmers; and further, that from
certain conversations which we had held with the illustrious
deceased a few months before his death, on the subject of
his paper, and from certain facts in our possession regarding
his views, we had spectacles through which to look at the
document in question, and a key to his meaning, which
most of the disputants wanted. The time has at length
come when these helps to the right understanding of so
great an authority should be no longer withheld from the
public. We shall betray no confidence; and should we be
compelled to speak somewhat more in the first person,
and of ourselves, than may seem quite accordant with good
taste, our readers will, we trust, suffer us to remind them
that we do not commit the fault very often, or very offensively,
and that the present employment of the personal
pronoun, just a little modified by the editorial <i>we</i>, seems
inevitably incident to the special line of statement on which
we propose to enter.</p>
<p>During the greater part of the years 1845 and 1846, the
Editor of the <i>Witness</i> was set aside from his professional
labours by a protracted illness, in part at least an effect of
the perhaps too assiduous prosecution of these labours at
a previous period. He had to cease per force even from
taking a very fixed view of what the Church was doing or
purposing; and when, early in January 1847, he returned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
after a long and dreary period of rustication, in improved
health to Edinburgh, he at least possessed the advantage&ndash;&ndash;much
prized by artists and authors in their respective walks&ndash;&ndash;of
being able to look over the length and breadth of his
subject with a <i>fresh</i> eye. And, in doing so, there was one
special circumstance in the survey suited to excite some
alarm. We found that in all the various schemes of the
Free Church, with but one exception, its extensively spread
membership and its more active leaders were thoroughly at
one; but that in that exceptional scheme they were not at
all at one. They were at one in their views respecting
the ecclesiastical character of ministers, elders, and church
courts, and of the absolute necessity which exists that these,
and these only, should possess the spiritual key. Further,
they were wholly at one in recognising the command of our
adorable Saviour to preach the gospel to all nations, as of
perpetual obligation on the Churches. But regarding what
we shall term, without taking an undue liberty with the language,
the pedagogical teaching of religion, they differed
<i>in toto</i>. Practically, and to all intents and purposes, the
schoolmaster, in the eye of the membership of our Church,
and of the other Scottish Churches, was simply a layman,
the proper business of whose profession was the communication
of secular learning. And as in choosing their tailors
and shoemakers the people selected for themselves the craftsmen
who made the best and handsomest shoes and clothes,
so, in selecting a schoolmaster for their children, they were
sure always to select the teacher who was found to turn out
the best scholars.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> All other things equal, they would have
preferred a serious, devout schoolmaster to one who was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
not serious nor devout, just as, <i>c&oelig;teris paribus</i>, they would
have preferred a serious shoemaker or tailor to a non-religious
maker of shoes or clothes; but religious character
was not permitted to stand as a compensatory item for professional
skill; nay, men who might be almost content to
put up with a botched coat or a botched pair of shoes for
the sake of the good man who spoiled them, were particularly
careful not to botch, on any account whatever, the
education of their children. In a country in which there
was more importance attached than in perhaps any other in
the world to the religious teaching of the minister, there
was so little importance attached to the religious teaching
of the schoolmaster, that, when weighed against even a
slight modicum of secular qualification, it was found to
have no sensible weight. And with this great practical fact
some of our leading men seemed to be so little acquainted,
that they were going on with the machinery of their educational
scheme, on a scale at least co-extensive with the Free
Church, as if, like that Church&ndash;&ndash;all-potent in her spiritual
character&ndash;&ndash;it had a moving power in the affections of the
people competent to speed it on. And it was the great discrepancy
with regard to this scheme which existed between
the feelings of the people and the anticipations of some of
our leading men, clerical and lay, that excited our alarm.
Unless that discrepancy be removed, we said&ndash;&ndash;unless the
anticipations of the men engaged in the laying down of this
scheme be sobered to the level of the feelings of the lay
membership of our Church, or, <i>vice versa</i>, the feelings of the
lay membership of our Church be raised to the level of the
anticipations of our leaders&ndash;&ndash;bankruptcy will be the infallible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
result. From the contributions of our laymen can
the scheme alone derive its support; and if our leaders lay
it down on a large scale, and our laymen contribute on a
small one, alas for its solvency! Such were our views,
and such our inferences, on this occasion; and to Thomas
Chalmers, at once our wisest and our humblest man&ndash;&ndash;patient
to hear, and sagacious to see&ndash;&ndash;we determined on
communicating them.</p>
<p>He had kindly visited the writer, to congratulate him in his
dwelling on his return to comparative health and strength;
and after a long and serious conversation, in which he urged
the importance of maintaining the <i>Witness</i> in honest independency,
uninfluenced by cliques and parties, whether
secular or ecclesiastical, the prospects of the Free Church
educational scheme were briefly discussed. He was evidently
struck by the view which we communicated, and
received it in far other than that parliamentary style which
can politely set aside, with some soothing half-compliment,
the suggestions that run counter to a favourite course of
policy already lined out and determined upon. In the discrepancy
which we pointed out to him he recognised a fact
of the practical kind, which rarely fail to influence the affairs
upon which they bear; and in accordance with his character&ndash;&ndash;for
no man could be more thoroughly convinced
that free discussion never hurts a good cause, and that
second thoughts are always wiser than first ones&ndash;&ndash;he expressed
a wish to see the educational question brought at
once to the columns of the <i>Witness</i>, and probed to its
bottom. We could not, however, see at that time how the
thing was to be introduced in a practical form, and preferred
waiting on for an opportunity, which in the course
of events soon occurred. The Government came forward
with its proposal of educational grants, and the question
was raised&ndash;&ndash;certainly not by the writer of these chapters&ndash;&ndash;whether
or no the Free Church could conscientiously avail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
herself of these. It was promptly decided by some few of
our leading men, clerical and lay, that she could not; and
we saw in the decision, unless carried by appeal to our
country ministers and the people, and by them reversed,
the introduction of a further element of certain dissolution
in our educational scheme.</p>
<p>The status of the schoolmaster had been made so exceedingly
ecclesiastical, and his profession so very spiritual,
that the money of that Government of the country whose
right and duty it is to educate its people, was regarded as
too vile and base a thing to be applied to his support.
There were even rumours afloat that our schoolmasters
were on the eve of being <i>ordained</i>. We trust, however,
that the report was a false one, or, at worst, that the men
who employed the word had made a slip in their English,
and for the time at least had forgot its meaning. <i>Ordination</i>
means that special act which gives status and standing
within the ecclesiastical province. It implies the enjoined
use of that spiritual key which is entrusted by Christ to His
Church, that it may be employed just as <i>He</i> directs, and in
no other way. The Presbyterian Church has as much right
to institute prelates as to ordain pedagogues. &#8216;Remember,&#8217;
said an ancient Scottish worthy, in &#8216;lifting up his protestation&#8217;
in troublous times, &#8216;that the Lord has fashioned His
Kirk by the uncounterfeited work of His own new creation;
or, as the prophet speaketh, &#8220;hath made us, and not
we ourselves;&#8221; and that we must not presume to fashion a
new portraiture of a Kirk, and a <i>new form of divine service,
which God in His word hath not before allowed</i>; seeing that,
were we to extend our authority further than the calling
we have of God doth permit&ndash;&ndash;as, namely, if we should (as
God forbid!) authorize the authority of bishops&ndash;&ndash;we should
bring into the Kirk of God the ordinance of man.&#8217; If
men are to depart from the &#8216;law and the testimony,&#8217; we
hold that the especial mode of their departure may be very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
much a matter of taste, and would, for our own part, prefer
bishops and cardinals to poor dominies of the gospel, somewhat
out at the elbows.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> The fine linen and the purple,
the cope and the stole, would at least have the effect of
giving that sort of pleasant relief to the widespread sable
of our Assemblies which they possessed of yore, ere they
for ever lost the gay uniform of the Lord High Commissioner,
the gold lace of his dragoon officers, and the glitter
of his pages in silver and scarlet. &#8216;We are two of the
humblest servants of Mother Church,&#8217; said the Prior and his
companion to Wamba, the jester of Rotherwood. &#8216;Two of
the humblest servants of Mother Church!&#8217; repeated Wamba;
&#8216;I should rather like to see her seneschals, her chief butlers,
and her other principal domestics.&#8217;</p>
<p>We again saw Chalmers, and, in a corner apart from a
social party, of which his kind and genial heart formed the
attractive centre, we found he thoroughly agreed with us in
holding that the time for the discussion of the educational
question had fully come. It was a question, he said, on
which he had not yet fully made up his mind: there was,
however, one point on which he seemed clear&ndash;&ndash;though, at
this distance of time, we cannot definitively say whether
the remark regarding it came spontaneously from himself,
or was suggested by any query of ours&ndash;&ndash;and that was the
right and duty of a Government to <i>instruct</i>, and consequently
of the governed to receive the instruction thus communicated,
if in itself good. We remarked in turn, that
there were various points on which we also had to &#8216;grope
our way&#8217; (a phrase to which the reader will find him referring
in his note, which we subjoin); but that regarding the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
inherently secular character of the schoolmaster, and the
right and duty of the Government to employ him in behalf
of its people, we had no doubt whatever. And so, parting
for the time, we commenced that series of articles which,
as they were not wholly without influence in communicating
juster views of the place and status of the schoolmaster
than had formerly obtained in the Free Church, and as
they had some little effect in leading the Church to take
at least one step in averting the otherwise inevitable ruin
which brooded over her educational scheme, the readers of
the <i>Witness</i> may perhaps remember. We were met in controversy
on the question by a man, the honesty of whose
purpose in this, as in every other matter, and the warmth
of whose zeal for the Church which he loved, and for which
he laboured, no one has ever questioned, and no one ever
will. And if, though possessed of solid, though perhaps
not brilliant talent, he failed on this occasion &#8216;in finding
his hands,&#8217; we are to seek an explanation of his failure
simply in the circumstance that truths of principle&ndash;&ndash;such
as those which establish the right and duty of every Government
to educate its people, or which demonstrate the
schoolmaster to possess a purely secular, not an ecclesiastical
standing&ndash;&ndash;or yet truths of fact, such as that for many
years the national teaching of Scotland has <i>not</i> been religious,
or that the better Scottish people will on no account
or consideration sacrifice the secular education of their children
to the dream of a spiritual pedagogy,&ndash;&ndash;are truths which
can neither be controverted nor set aside. He did on one
occasion, during the course&ndash;&ndash;what he no doubt afterwards regretted&ndash;&ndash;raise
against us the cry of infidelity,&ndash;&ndash;a cry which,
when employed respecting matters on which Christ or His
apostles have not spoken, really means no more than that
he who employs it, if truly a good man, is bilious, or has
a bad stomach, or has lost the thread of his argument or
the equanimity of his temper. Feeling somewhat annoyed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
however, we wished to see Chalmers once more; but the
matter had not escaped his quick eye, and his kind heart
suggested the remedy. In the course of the day in which
our views and reasonings were posted as infidel, we received
the following note from Morningside:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-right:3em; text-align:right;" >    <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Morningside</span>, <i>March 13, 1847</i>.</p>
<p><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>My dear Sir</span>,&ndash;&ndash;You are getting nobly on on education;
not only groping your way, but making way, and that by a
very sensible step in advance this day.</p>
<p>On my own mind the truth evolves itself very gradually;
and I am yet a far way from the landing-place. Kindest
respects to Mrs. Miller; and with earnest prayer for the
comfort and happiness of both, I ever am, my dear Sir,
yours very truly,</p>
<p style="margin-right:3em; text-align:right;" >        <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Thomas Chalmers.</span></p>
<p style="font-size:0.8em;" >  Hugh Miller, Esq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, Thomas Chalmers, by his sympathy and his
connivance, had become as great an infidel as ourselves;
and we have submitted to our readers the evidence of the
fact, fully certified under his own hand.<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> There is a sort
of perfection in everything; and perfection once reached,
deterioration usually begins. And when, in bandying the
phrases <i>infidel</i> and <i>infidelity</i>&ndash;&ndash;like the feathered missiles
in the game of battledore and shuttlecock&ndash;&ndash;they fell upon
Chalmers, we think there was a droll felicity in the accident,
which constitutes for it an irresistible claim of being
the terminal one in the series. The climax reached its
point of extremest elevation; for even should our infidel-dubbers
do their best or worst now, it is not at all likely
they will find out a second Chalmers to hit.</p>
<p>We concluded our course of educational articles; and
though we afterwards saw the distinguished man to whom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
our eye so frequently turned, as, under God, the wise pilot of
the Free Church, and were honoured by a communication
from him, dictated to his secretary, we did not again touch
on the subject of education. We were, however, gratified
to learn, from men much in his confidence and company&ndash;&ndash;we
hope we do not betray trust in referring to the Rev. Mr.
Tasker of the West Port as one of these&ndash;&ndash;that he regarded
our entire course with a feeling of general approval akin
to that to which he had given expression in his note. It
further gratifies us to reflect that our course had the effect
of setting his eminently practical mind a-working on the
whole subject, and led to the production of the inestimably
valuable document, long and carefully pondered, which will
do more to settle the question of national education in Scotland
than all the many volumes which have been written
regarding it. As in a well-known instance in Scottish story,
it is the &#8216;dead Douglas&#8217; who is to &#8216;win the field.&#8217;</p>
<p>But we lag in our narrative. That melancholy event
took place which cast a shade of sadness over Christendom;
and in a few weeks after, the posthumous document,
kindly communicated to us by the family of the deceased,
appeared in the columns of the <i>Witness</i>. We perused it
with intense interest; and what we saw in the first perusal
was, that Chalmers had gone far beyond us; and in the
second, that, in laying down his first principles, he had
looked at the subject, as was his nature, in a broader and
more general aspect, and had unlocked the difficulty which
it presented in a more practical and statesmanlike manner.
<i>We</i> had, indeed, considered in the abstract the right and
duty of the civil magistrate to educate his people; but our
main object being to ward off otherwise inevitable bankruptcy
from a scheme of our Church, and having to deal
with a sort of vicious Cameronianism, that would not accept
of the magistrate&#8217;s money, even though he gave the
Bible and the Shorter Catechism along with it, we had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
merely contended that money given in connection with the
Bible and Shorter Catechism is a very excellent thing, and
especially so to men who cannot fulfil their obligations or pay
their debts without it. But Chalmers had looked beyond
the difficulties of a scheme, to the emergencies of a nation.</p>
<p>At the request of many of our readers, we have reprinted
his document in full, as it originally appeared.<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> First, let
it be remarked that, after briefly stating what he deemed
the optimity of the question, he passes on to what he considered
the only mode of settling it practically, in the present
divided state of the Church and country. And in
doing so he lays down, as a preliminary step, the absolute
right and duty of the Government to educate, altogether
independently of the theological differences or divisions
which may obtain among the people or in the Churches.
&#8216;As there seems no reason,&#8217; he says, &#8216;why, because of these
unresolved differences, a public measure for the health of
all, for the recreation of all, for the economic advancement
of all, should be held in abeyance, there seems as little
reason why, because of these differences, a public measure
for raising the general intelligence of all should be held in
abeyance.&#8217; Such is the principle which he enunciates regarding
the party possessing the right to <i>educate</i>. Let the
reader next mark in what terms he speaks of the party <i>to be</i>
educated, or under whose immediate superintendence the
education is to be conducted. Those who most widely misunderstand
the Doctor&#8217;s meaning&ndash;&ndash;from the circumstance,
perhaps, that their views are most essentially at variance
with those which he entertained&ndash;&ndash;seem to hold that this
<i>absolute</i> right on the part of Government is somehow
<i>conditional</i> on the parties to be educated, or to superintend
the education, coming forward to them <i>in the character of
Churches</i>. They deem it necessary to the integrity of his
meaning, that Presbyterians should come forward as Presbyterians,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
Puseyites as Puseyites, Papists as Papists, and
Socinians as Socinians; in which case, of course, all could
be set right so far as the Free Church conscience was concerned
in the matter, by taking the State&#8217;s grant with the
one hand, and holding out an indignant protest against its
extension to the erroneous sects in the other. But that
Chalmers could have contemplated anything so monstrous
as that <i>Scotchmen</i> should think of coming forward simply as
Scotchmen, they cannot believe. He must have regarded
the State&#8217;s <i>unconditional</i> right to educate as <i>conditional</i> after
all, and dependent on the form assumed by the party on
which or through which it was to be exercised. Let the
reader examine for himself, and see whether there exists in
the document a single expression suited to favour such a
view. Nothing can be plainer than the words &#8216;Parliament,&#8217;
&#8216;Government,&#8217; &#8216;State,&#8217; &#8216;Legislature,&#8217; employed to designate
the educating party on the one hand; and surely nothing
plainer than the words &#8216;people,&#8217; &#8216;<i>men</i> of all Churches and
denominations,&#8217; &#8216;families of the land,&#8217; and &#8216;society at large,&#8217;
made use of in designating the party to be educated, or
entrusted with the educational means or machinery, on the
other. There is a well-grounded confidence expressed in
the Christian and philanthropic zeal which obtain throughout
society; but the only bodies ecclesiastical which we
find specially named&ndash;&ndash;if, indeed, one of these can be regarded
as at all ecclesiastical&ndash;&ndash;are the &#8216;Unitarians and the
Catholics.&#8217; It was with the broad question of national education
in its relation to two great parties placed in happy
opposition, as the &#8216;inner hall of legislation&#8217; and the &#8216;outer
field of society,&#8217; that we find Dr. Chalmers mainly dealing.
And yet the document <i>does</i> contain palpable reference to
the Government scheme. There is one clause in which it
urges the propriety of &#8216;leaving [the matter of religion] to
the parties who had to do with the erection and management
of the schools which [the rulers of the country] had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
been called on to assist.&#8217; But the greater includes the less,
and the much that is general in the paper is in no degree
neutralized by the little in it that is particular. The Hon.
Mr. Fox Maule could perhaps throw some additional light
on this matter. It was at his special desire, and in consequence
of a conversation on the subject which he held with
Chalmers, that the document was drawn up. The nature
of the request could not, of course, alter whatever is absolutely
present in what it was the means of producing; but
it would be something to know whether what the statesman
asked was a decision on a special educational scheme, or&ndash;&ndash;what
any statesman might well desire to possess&ndash;&ndash;the judgment
of so wise and great a man on the all-important subject
of national education.</p>
<p>It will be found that the following valuable letters from
Dr. Guthrie and the Hon. Mr. Fox Maule determine the
meaning of Dr. Chalmers on his own authority:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-right:3em; text-align:right;" >        2, <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Lauriston Lane</span>, <i>March 5, 1850</i>.</p>
<p><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>My dear Mr. Miller</span>,&ndash;&ndash;When such conflicting statements
were advanced as to the bearing of Dr. Chalmers&#8217;
celebrated paper on education, although I had no doubt in
my own mind that the view you had taken of that valuable
document was the correct one, and had that view confirmed
by a conversation I had with his son-in-law, Mr. M&#8217;Kenzie,
who heard Dr Chalmers discuss the matter in London, and
acted, indeed, as his amanuensis in writing that paper; yet
I thought it were well also to see whether Mr. Maule could
throw any light on the subject. I wrote him with that
object in view; and while we must regret that we are called
to differ from some most eminent and excellent friends on
this important question, it both comforts and confirms us
to find another most important testimony in the letter
which I now send to you, in favour of our opinion, that
Dr. Chalmers, had God spared him to this day, would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
lifted up his mighty voice to advocate the views in which
we are agreed.</p>
<p>Into the fermenting mind of the public it is the duty of
every one to cast in whatever may, by God&#8217;s blessing, lead
to a happy termination of this great question; and with
this view I send you the letter which I have had the honour
to receive from Mr. Maule.&ndash;&ndash;Believe me, yours ever,</p>

<p><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>My dear Dr. Guthrie</span>,&ndash;&ndash;When you wrote me some
time since upon the subject of the communication made to
me by the late Dr. Chalmers upon the all-important question
of education, I could not take upon myself to say
positively (though I had very little doubt in my mind)
whether that document took its origin in a desire expressed
by me to have Dr. Chalmers&#8217; opinion on the general
question of education, or merely upon the scheme laid
down and pursued by the Committee of Privy Council.
My impression has always been, that Dr. Chalmers addressed
himself to the question as a whole; and on looking
over my papers a few days since, I find that impression
quite confirmed by the following sentence, in a note in Dr.
Chalmers&#8217; handwriting, bearing date 21st May 1847:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;I
hope that by to-morrow night I shall have prepared a few
brief sentences on the <i>subject of education</i>.&#8217;</p>
<p>None of us thought how inestimable these brief sentences
were to become, forming, as they do, the last written evidence
of the tone of his great mind on this subject.</p>
<p>Should you address yourself to this question, you are, in
my opinion, fully justified in dealing with the <i>memorandum</i>
as referring to general and national arrangements, and not
to those which are essentially of a temporary and varying
character.&ndash;&ndash;Believe me, with great esteem, yours sincerely,</p>

<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER SECOND.</h3>
<p class="ch_summary" >Right and Duty of the Civil Magistrate to educate the People&ndash;&ndash;Founded on two
distinct Principles, the one economic, the other judicial&ndash;&ndash;Right and Duty of
the Parent&ndash;&ndash;Natural, not Ecclesiastical&ndash;&ndash;Examination of the purely Ecclesiastical
Claim&ndash;&ndash;The real Rights in the case those of the State, the Parent, and the
Ratepayer&ndash;&ndash;The terms Parent and Ratepayer convertible into the one term
Householder.</p>
<p>Wherever mind is employed, thought will be evolved;
and in all questions of a practical character, truth, when
honestly sought, is ultimately found. And so we deem it
a happy circumstance, that there should be more minds
honestly engaged at the present time on the educational
problem than at perhaps any former period. To the
upright light will arise. The question cannot be too profoundly
pondered, nor too carefully discussed; and at the
urgent request of not a few of our better readers, we purpose
examining it anew in a course of occasional articles,
convinced that its crisis has at length come, just as the
crisis of the Church question had in reality come when the
late Dr. M&#8217;Crie published his extraordinary pamphlet;<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
and that it must depend on the part now taken by the Free
Church in this matter, whether some ten years hence she
is to posses any share, even the slightest, in the education
of the country. We ask our readers severely to test all our
statements, whether of principle or of fact, and to suffer
nothing in the least to influence them which is not rational,
or which is not true.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, we hold with Chalmers, that it is
unquestionably the right and duty of the civil magistrate to
educate his people, altogether independently of the religion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
which <i>he himself holds</i>, or of the religious differences which
may unhappily obtain among <i>them</i>. Even should there be
as many sects in a country as there are families or individuals,
the right and duty still remain. Religion, in such
circumstances, can palpably form no part of a Government
scheme of tuition; but there is nothing in the element of
religious difference to furnish even a pretext for excluding
those important secular branches which bear reference to
the principles of trade, the qualities of matter, the relations
of numbers, the properties of figured space, the philosophy
of grammar, or the form and body which in various countries
and ages literature and the <i>belles lettres</i> have assumed.
And this right and duty of a Government to instruct, rest,
we hold, on two distinct principles,&ndash;&ndash;the one <i>economic</i>, the
other <i>judicial</i>. Education adds immensely to the <i>economic</i>
value of the subjects of a State. The professional and
mercantile men who in this country live by their own exertions,
and pay the income tax, and all the other direct
taxes, are educated men; whereas its uneducated men do
not pay the direct taxes, and, save in the article of intoxicating
drink, very little of the indirect ones; and a large
proportion of their number, so far from contributing to the
national wealth, are positive burdens on the community.
And on the class of facts to which this important fact
belongs rests the <i>economic</i> right and duty of the civil magistrate
to educate.</p>
<p>His <i>judicial</i> right and duty are founded on the circumstance,
that the laws which he promulgates are <i>written</i> laws,
and that what he writes for the guidance of the people, the
people ought to be enabled to read; seeing that to punish
for the breach of a law, of the existence of which he who
breaks it has been left in ignorance, is not man-law, but
what Jeremy Bentham well designates dog-law, and altogether
unjust. We are, of course, far from supposing that
every British subject who can read is to peruse the vast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
library which the British Acts of themselves compose; but
we hold that education forms the only direct means through
which written law, as a regulator of conduct, can be known,
and that, in consequence, in its practical breadth and
average aspect, it is only educated men who know it, and
only uneducated men who are ignorant of it. And hence
the derivation of the magistrate&#8217;s <i>judicial</i> right and duty.
But on this part of our subject, with Free Churchmen for
our readers, we need not surely insist. Our Church has
homologated at least the general principle of the civil
magistrate&#8217;s right and duty, by becoming the recipient of
his educational grant. If he has no right to give, she can
have no right to receive. If he, instead of performing a
duty, has perpetrated a wrong, she, to all intents and purposes,
being guilty of receipt, is a participator in the crime.
Nay, further, let it be remarked that, as indicated by the
speeches of some of our abler and more influential men,
there seems to exist a decided wish on the part of the Free
Church, that the State, in its educational grants, should
assume a purely secular character, and dispense with the
certificate of religious training which it at present demands,&ndash;&ndash;a
certificate which, though anomalously required of sects
of the most opposite tenets, constitutes notwithstanding, in
this business of grants, the sole recognition of religion on
the part of the Government. Now this, if a fact at all, is
essentially a noticeable and pregnant one, and shows how
much opposite parties are in reality at one on a principle
regarding which they at least <i>seem</i> to dispute.</p>
<p>The right and duty of the civil magistrate thus established,
let us next consider another main element in the question,&ndash;&ndash;the
right and duty of the parent. It is, we assert, imperative
on every parent in Scotland and elsewhere to educate
his children; and on the principle that he is a joint
contributor with the Government to the support of every
national teacher&ndash;&ndash;the Government giving <i>salary</i>, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
parent <i>fees</i>&ndash;&ndash;we assert further, that should the Government
give its salary &#8216;exclusively as the expression of its value for
a good <i>secular</i> education,&#8217; <i>he</i> may, notwithstanding, demand
that his fees should be received as the representative of <i>his</i>
value for a good <i>religious</i> education. Whether his principles
be those of the Voluntary or of the Establishment-man,
the same schoolmaster who is a secular teacher in
relation to the Government, may be a religious teacher in
relation to him. For unless the State positively <i>forbid</i> its
schoolmaster to communicate religious instruction, he exists
to the parent, in virtue of the fees given and received, in
exactly the circumstances of the teacher of any adventure
school.</p>
<p>Let us further remark, that the rights of the parent in the
matter of education are not <i>ecclesiastical</i>, but <i>natural</i> rights.
The writer of this article is one of the parents of Scotland;
and, simply as such, he claims for himself the right of
choosing his children&#8217;s teacher on his own responsibility,
and of determining what his children are to be taught.
The Rev. Dr. Thomas Guthrie is his minister; and <i>he</i> also
is one of the parents of Scotland, and enjoys, as such, a
right identical in all respects with that of his parishioner
and hearer. But it is only an identical and co-equal right.
Should the writer send his boy to a Socialist or Popish
school, to be taught either gross superstition or gross infidelity,
the minister would have a right to interfere, and, if
entreaty and remonstrance failed, to bring him to discipline
for so palpable a breach of his baptismal engagement. If,
on the other hand, it was the minister who had sent his boy
to the Socialist or Popish school, the parishioner would
have a right to interfere, and, were entreaty and remonstrance
disregarded, to bring <i>him</i> to discipline. Minister
and parishioner stand, we repeat, in this matter, on exactly
the same level. Nor have ten, twenty, a hundred, a thousand,
twenty thousand, or a hundred thousand lay parents,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
or yet ten, twenty, a hundred, or a thousand clerical parents,
whether existing as a congregation or hundreds of congregations
on the one hand, or as a Presbytery, Synod, or
General Assembly on the other, rights in this matter that in
the least differ in their nature from the rights possessed by
the single clergyman, Dr. Guthrie, or by the single layman,
the Editor of the <i>Witness</i>. The sole right which exists in
the case&ndash;&ndash;that of the parent&ndash;&ndash;is a <i>natural</i> right, not an
<i>ecclesiastical</i> one; and the sole modification which it can
receive from the superadded element of Church membership
is simply that modification to which we refer as founded
on the religious duty of both member and minister, in its
relation to ecclesiastical law and the baptismal vow.</p>
<p>Nor, be it observed, does this our recognition, in our
character as a Church member, of ecclesiastical rule and
authority, give our minister any true grounds for urging that
it is our bounden duty, in virtue of our parental engagements,
and from the existence of such general texts as the
often quoted one, &#8216;Train up a child,&#8217; etc., to send our children
to some school in which religion is expressly taught.
Far less does it give him a right to <i>demand</i> any such thing.
We are Free Church in our principles; and the grand distinctive
principle for which, during the protracted Church
controversy, we never ceased to contend, was simply the
right of choosing our own religious teacher, on the strength
of our own convictions, and on our own exclusive responsibility.
We laughed to scorn the idea that the three items
of Dr. George Cook&#8217;s ceaseless iterations&ndash;&ndash;life, literature,
and doctrine&ndash;&ndash;formed the full tale of ministerial qualification:
there was yet a fourth item, infinitely more important
than all the others put together, viz. <i>godliness</i>, or religion
proper, or, in yet other words, the regeneration of the
whole man by the Spirit of God. And on this last item
we held that it was the right and duty of the people who
Chose for themselves, <i>and for their children</i>, a religious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
teacher, and of none others, clerical or lay, solemnly to
decide. And while we still hold by this sacred principle
on the one hand, we see clearly, on the other, that the sole
qualifications of our Free Church teachers, as prepared in our
Normal Schools, correspond to but Dr. Cook&#8217;s three items;
nay, that instead of exceeding, they fall greatly short of
these. The certificate of character which the young candidates
bring to the institution answers but lamely to the
item &#8216;<i>life</i>;&#8217; the amount of secular instruction imparted to
them within its walls answers but inadequately to the item
&#8216;<i>literature</i>;&#8217; while the modicum of theological training received,
most certainly not equal to a four years&#8217; course
of theology at a Divinity Hall, answers but indifferently
to the crowning item of the three&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;<i>doctrine</i>.&#8217; That paramount
item, conversion on the part of the teacher to God,
is still unaccounted for; and we contend that, respecting
that item, the parent, and the parent only, has a right to
decide, all difficult and doubtful as the decision may be:
for be it remembered, that there exist no such data on
which to arrive at a judgment in cases of this nature, as
exist in the choosing of a minister. And though we would
deem it eminently right and proper that our child should
read his daily Scripture lesson to some respectable schoolmaster,
a believer in the divine authority of revelation, and
should repeat to him his weekly tale of questions from the
National Catechism, yet to the <i>extempore</i> religious teaching
of no merely respectable schoolmaster would we subject
our child&#8217;s heart and conscience. For we hold that the
religious lessons of the unregenerate lack regenerating life;
and that whatever in this all-important department does
not intenerate and soften, rarely fails to harden and to sear.
Religious preachments from a secular heart are the droppings
of a petrifying spring, which convert all that they fall
upon into stone. Further, we hold that a mistake regarding
the character of a schoolmaster authorized to teach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
religion <i>extempore</i> might be greatly more serious, and might
involve an immensely deeper responsibility, than a similar
mistake regarding a minister. The minister preaches to
grown men&ndash;&ndash;a large proportion of them members of the
Church&ndash;&ndash;not a few of them office-bearers in its service,
and competent, in consequence, to judge respecting both
the doctrine which he exhibits and the mode of its exhibition;
but it is children, immature of judgment, and extremely
limited in their knowledge, whom the religion-teaching
schoolmaster has to address. Nay, more: in
choosing a minister, we may mistake the character of the
man; but there can be no mistake made regarding the
character of the office, seeing that it is an office appointed
by God Himself; whereas in choosing a religion-teaching
schoolmaster, we may mistake the character of both the
man and the office too. We are responsible in the one
case for only the man; we are responsible in the other for
both the man and the office.</p>
<p>We have yet another objection to any authoritative interference
on the part of ecclesiastical courts with the natural
rights and enjoined duties of the parent in the matter of
education. Even though we fully recognised some conscientious
teacher as himself in possession of the divine
life, we might regard him as very unfitted, from some
natural harshness of temper, or some coldness of heart, or
some infirmity of judgment, for being a missionary of religion
to the children under his care. At one period early
in life we spent many a leisure hour in drawing up a
gossiping little history of our native town, and found, in
tracing out the <i>memorabilia</i> of its parish school, that the
Rev. John Russell, afterwards of Kilmarnock and Stirling,
and somewhat famous in Scottish literature as one of the
clerical antagonists of Burns, had taught in it for twelve
years, and that several of his pupils (now long since departed)
still lived. We sought them out one by one, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
succeeded in rescuing several curious passages in his history,
and in finding that, though not one among them
doubted the sincerity of his religion, nor yet his conscientiousness
as a schoolmaster, they all equally regarded him
as a harsh-tempered, irascible man, who succeeded in inspiring
all his pupils with fear, but not one of them with
love. Now, to no such type of schoolmaster, however
strong our conviction of his personal piety, would we
entrust the religious teaching of our child. If necessitated
to place our boy under his pedagogical rule and superintendence,
we would address him thus: Lacking time, and
mayhap ability, ourselves to instruct our son, we entrust
him to you, and this simply on the same division of labour
principle on which we give the making of our shoes to a
shoemaker, and the making of our clothes to a tailor. And
in order that you may not lack the power necessary to the
accomplishment of your task&ndash;&ndash;for we hold that &#8216;folly is
bound up in the heart of a child&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;we make over to you
our authority to admonish and correct. But though we
can put into your hands the parental rod&ndash;&ndash;with an advice,
however, to use it discreetly and with temper&ndash;&ndash;there are
things which we cannot communicate to you. We cannot
make over to you our child&#8217;s affection for us, nor yet our
affection for our child: with these joys &#8216;a stranger intermeddleth
not.&#8217; And as religious teaching without love,
and conducted under the exclusive influence of fear, may
and must be barren&ndash;&ndash;nay, worse than barren&ndash;&ndash;we ask you
to leave this part of our duty as a parent entirely to ourselves.
<i>Our</i> duty it is, and to you we delegate no part of
it; and this, not because we deem it unimportant, but
because we deem it important in the highest degree,
and are solicitous that no unkindly element should mar it
in its effects. Now where, we ask, is the ecclesiastical
office-bearer who, in his official character, or in any character
or capacity whatever, has a right authoritatively to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
challenge our rejection, on our own parental responsibility,
of the religious teaching of even a converted schoolmaster,
on purely reasonable grounds such as these? Or where is
the ecclesiastical office-bearer who has an authoritative right
to challenge our yet weightier Free Church objection to the
religious teaching of a schoolmaster whom we cannot avoid
regarding as an unregenerate man, or whom we at least do
not know to be a regenerate one? Or yet further, where
is the ecclesiastical office-bearer who has a right authoritatively
to bear down or set aside our purely Protestant
caveat against a teacher of religion who, in his professional
capacity, has no place or standing in the word of God?
The right and duty of the civil magistrate in all circumstances
to educate his people, and of parents to choose
their children&#8217;s teacher, and to determine what they are to
be taught, we are compelled to recognise; and there seems
to be a harmony between the two rights&ndash;&ndash;the parental and
the magisterial, with the <i>salary</i> of the one and the <i>fees</i> of
the other&ndash;&ndash;suited, we think, to unlock many a difficulty;
but the authoritative standing, in this question, of the
ecclesiastic as such, we have hitherto failed to see. The
parent, as a Church member or minister, is amenable to
discipline; but his natural rights in the matter are simply
those of the parent, and his political rights simply those of
the subject and the ratepayer.</p>
<p>And in this educational question certain political rights
<i>are</i> involved. In the present state of things, the parish
schoolmasters of the kingdom are chosen by the parish
ministers and parish heritors: the two elements involved
are the ecclesiastical and the political. But while we see
the parish minister as but the mere idle image of a state
of things passed away for ever, and possessed in his ministerial
capacity of merely a statutory right, which, though it
exists to-day, may be justly swept away to-morrow, we recognise
the heritor as possessed of a real right; and what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
we challenge is merely its engrossing extent, not its nature.
We regard it as just in kind, but exorbitant in degree;
and on the simple principle that the money of the State is
the money of the people, and that the people have a right
to determine that it be not misapplied or misdirected, we
would, with certain limitations, extend to the ratepayers as
a body the privileges, in this educational department, now
exclusively exercised by the heritors. In that educational
franchise which we would fain see extended to the Scottish
people, we recognise two great elements, and but two only,&ndash;&ndash;the
natural, or that of the parent; and the political, or
that of the ratepayer. These form the two opposite sides
of the pyramid; and, though diverse in their nature, let
the reader mark how nicely for all practical purposes they
converge into the point, <i>householder</i>. The householders of
Scotland include all the ratepayers of Scotland. The householders
of Scotland include also all the parents of Scotland.
We would therefore fix on the householders of a parish as
the class in whom the right of nominating the parish schoolmaster
should be vested. But on the same principle of
high expediency on which we exclude householders of a
certain standing from exercising the political franchise in
the election of a member of Parliament, would we exclude
certain other householders, of, however, a much lower standing,
from voting in the election of a parish schoolmaster.
We are not prepared to be Chartists in either department,&ndash;&ndash;the
educational or the political; and this simply on the
ground that Chartism in either would be prejudicial to the
general good. On this part of the subject, however, we
shall enter at full length in our next.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we again urge our readers carefully to examine
for themselves all our statements and propositions,&ndash;&ndash;to take
nothing on trust,&ndash;&ndash;to set no store by any man&#8217;s <i>ipse dixit</i>,
be he editor or elder, minister or layman. In this question,
as in a thousand others, &#8216;truth lies at the bottom of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
well;&#8217; and if she be not now found and consulted, to the
exclusion of every prejudice, and the disregard of every
petty little interest and sinister motive, it will be ill ten
years hence with the Free Church of Scotland in her
character as an educator. Her safety rests, in the present
crisis, in the just and the true, and in the just and the true
only.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER THIRD.</h3>
<p class="ch_summary" >Parties to whom the Educational Franchise might be safely extended&ndash;&ndash;House Proprietors,
House Tenants of a certain standing, Farmers, Crofters&ndash;&ndash;Scheme of an
Educational Faculty&ndash;&ndash;Effects of the desired Extension&ndash;&ndash;It would restore the
National Schools to the People of the Nation.</p>
<p>It is the right and duty of every Government to educate
its people, whatever the kinds or varieties of religion which
may obtain among them;&ndash;&ndash;it is the right and duty of every
parent to select, on his own responsibility, his children&#8217;s
teacher, and to determine what his children are to be
taught;&ndash;&ndash;it is the right and duty of every member of the
commonwealth to see that the commonwealth&#8217;s money,
devoted to educational purposes, be not squandered on
incompetent men, and, in virtue of his contributions as a
ratepayer, to possess a voice with the parents of a country
in the selection of its salaried schoolmasters. There exist,
on the one hand, the right and duty of the State; there
exist, on the other, the rights and duties of the parents and
ratepayers; and we find both parents and ratepayers presenting
themselves in the aggregate, and for all practical
purposes in this matter, as a single class, viz. the <i>householders</i>
of the kingdom. But as, in dealing with these in
purely political questions, we exclude a certain portion of
them from the exercise of the <i>political</i> franchise, and that
simply because, as classes, they are uninformed or dangerous,
and might employ power, if they possessed it, to the
public prejudice, so would we exclude a certain proportion
of them, on similar grounds, from the <i>educational</i> franchise.
In selecting, however, the safe classes of householders, we
would employ tests somewhat dissimilar in their character
from those to which the Reform Act extends its exclusive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
sanction, and establish a somewhat different order of qualifications
from those which it erects.</p>
<p>In the first place, we would fain extend the educational
franchise to all those householders of Scotland who inhabit
houses of their own, however humble in kind, or however
low the valuation of their rental. We know not a safer or
more solid, or, in the main, more intelligent class, than
those working men of the country who, with the savings of
half a lifetime, build or purchase a dwelling for themselves,
and then sit down rent-free for the rest of their lives, each
&#8216;the monarch of a shed.&#8217; With these men we are intimately
acquainted, for we have lived and laboured among them;
and very rarely have we failed to find the thatched domicile,
of mayhap two little rooms and a closet, with a patch of
garden-ground behind, of which some hard-handed country
mechanic or labourer had, through his own exertions, become
the proud possessor, forming a higher certificate of
character than masters the most conscientious and discerning
could bestow upon their <i>employ&eacute;s</i>, or even Churches
themselves upon their members. Nor is this house-owning
qualification much less valuable when it has been derived
by inheritance&ndash;&ndash;not wrought for; seeing that the man
who retains his little patrimony unsquandered must be at
least a steady, industrious man, the slave of no expensive
or disreputable vice. Let us remark, however, that we
would not attach the educational franchise to property as
such: the proprietor of the house, whether a small house
or a large one, would require to be the <i>bona fide</i> inhabitant
of the dwelling which he occupied, for at least a considerable
portion of every year. The second class to which we
would fain see the educational franchise extended are all
those householders of the kingdom who tenant houses of
five pounds annual rent and upwards, who settle with their
landlords not oftener than twice every twelvemonth, and
who are at least a year entered on possession. By fixing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
the qualification thus high, and rejecting the monthly or
weekly rent-payer, the country would get rid of at least
nineteen-twentieths of the dangerous classes,&ndash;&ndash;the agricultural
labourers, who wander about from parish to parish,
some six or eight months in one locality, and some ten or
twelve in another; the ignorant immigrant Irish, who
tenant the poorer hovels of so many of our western coast
parishes; and last, not least, all the migratory population of
our larger towns, who rarely reside half a year in the same
dwelling, and who, though they may in some instances pay
at more than the rate of the yearly five pounds, pay it
weekly, or by the fortnight or month. We regret, however,
that there is a really worthy class which such a qualification
would exclude,&ndash;&ndash;ploughmen, labourers, and country
mechanics, who reside permanently in humble cottages, the
property of the owner of the soil, and who, though their
course through life lies on the bleak edge of poverty, are
God-fearing, worthy men, at least morally qualified to give,
in the election of a teacher, an honest and not unintelligent
voice. And yet, hitherto at least, we have failed to see
any principle which a British statesman would recognise
as legitimate, on which this class could be included in the
educational franchise, and their dangerous neighbours of
the same political status kept out. There is yet a third
very important class whom we would fain see in possession
of the educational franchise,&ndash;&ndash;those householders of Scotland
who till the soil as tenants, whether with or without
leases, or whether the annual rent which they pay amounts
to three or to three thousand pounds. The tillers of the soil
are a fixed class, greatly more permanent, even where there
exists no lease, than the mere tenant householders; and
they include, especially in the Highlands of Scotland, and
the poorer districts of the low country, a large proportion
of the country&#8217;s parentage. They are in the main, too, an
eminently safe class, and not less so where the farms are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
small and the dwellings upon them mere cottages&ndash;&ndash;to
which, save for the surrounding croft or farm, no franchise
could attach&ndash;&ndash;than where they live in elegant houses, and
are the lessees of hundreds of acres. And such are the
three great classes to which, as composing the solid body
of the Scottish nation&ndash;&ndash;to the exclusion of little more than
the mere rags that hang loosely on its vestments&ndash;&ndash;would
we extend, did we possess the power, the educational
franchise.</p>
<p>In order, however, to render a franchise thus liberally
restricted more safe and salutary still, we would demand
not only certain qualifications on the part of the parents
and ratepayers of the country, without which they could
not be permitted to <i>vote</i>, but also certain other qualifications
on the part of the country&#8217;s schoolmasters, without which
they could not be <i>voted for</i>. We would thus impart to the
scheme such a twofold aspect of security as that for which
in a purely ecclesiastical matter we contended, when we
urged that none but Church members should be permitted
to choose their own ministers; and that none but ministers
pronounced duly qualified in life, literature, and doctrine,
by a competent ecclesiastical court, should they be <i>permitted</i>
to choose. There ought to exist a teaching Faculty
as certainly as there exists a medical or legal Faculty, or as
there exists in the Church what is essentially a preacher-licensing
Faculty. The membership of a Church are unfitted
in their aggregate character to judge respecting at
least the literature of the young licentiate whom, in their
own and their children&#8217;s behalf, they call to the pastoral
charge;&ndash;&ndash;the people of a district, however shrewd and
solid, are equally unqualified to determine whether the
young practitioner of medicine or of law who settles
among them is competently acquainted with his profession,
and so a fit person to be entrusted with the care of their
health or the protection of their property. And hence the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
necessity which exists in all these cases for testing, licensing,
diploma-giving courts or boards, composed of men
qualified to decide regarding those special points of ability
or acquirement which the people, as such, cannot try for
themselves. In no case, however, are courts of this nature
more imperatively required than in the case of the schoolmaster.
Neither the amount of literature which he possesses,
nor yet his mastery over the most approved modes
of communicating it, can be tested by the people, who,
as parents and ratepayers, possess the exclusive right to
make choice of him for their parish or district school; and
hence the necessity that what they cannot do for themselves
should be previously done for them by some competent
court or board, and that no teacher who did not possess
a licence or diploma should be eligible to at least an
endowed seminary supported by the public money. With,
of course, the qualifications of the mere adventure-teacher,
whether supported by Churches or individuals, we would
permit no board to interfere. As to the composition of
the board itself, that, we hold, might be determined on
very simple principles. Let the College-bred teachers of
Scotland, associated with its University professors, select
for themselves, out of their own number, a dean or chairman,
and a court or committee, legally qualified by Act of
Parliament stringently to try all teachers who may present
themselves before them, in order to be rendered eligible for
a national school, and to grant them licences or diplomas,
legally representative of professional qualification. Whether
a teacher, on his election by the people, might not be a
second time tried, especially on behalf of the State and
the ratepayers, by a Government inspectorship, and thus a
check on the board be instituted, we are not at present
called on to determine; but on this we are clear, that the
certificate of no Normal School, in behalf of its own pupils,
ought to be received otherwise than as a mere makeweight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
in the general item of professional character; seeing that
any such document would be as much a certificate of the
Normal School&#8217;s own ability in rearing efficient teachers,
as of the pedagogical skill of the teachers which it reared.
The vitiating element of self-interest would scarce fail to
induce, ultimately at least, a suspicious habit of self-recommendation.</p>
<p>Such, then, in this matter, is our full tale of qualification,
pedagogical and popular, of the educators of the country
on the one hand, and of the educational franchise-holders
of the country on the other. And now we request the
reader to mark one mighty result of the arrangement, which
no other yet set in opposition to it could possibly produce.
There are in Scotland about one thousand one hundred
national schools, supported by national resources; and, of
consequence, though fallen into the hands of a mere sect,
which in some localities does not include a tithe of the
population, they of right belong to the Scottish people.
And these schools of the <i>people</i> that extension of the
educational franchise which we desiderate would not fail
to restore to the <i>people</i>. It would put them once more in
possession of what was their own property <i>de facto</i> at the
Revolution (for at that period, when, with a few inconsiderable
exceptions, they were all of one creed, the ministry of
the Established Church virtually represented them), and of
what has been <i>de jure</i> their property ever since. But by
the ministry of no one Church can the people be represented
now. The long rule of Moderatism,&ndash;&ndash;the consequent
formation of the Secession and Relief Churches,&ndash;&ndash;the
growth of Independency and Episcopacy,&ndash;&ndash;and last,
but not least in the series, the Disruption, and the instantaneous
creation of the Free Church, have put an end to
that state of things for ever. The time has in the course
of Providence fairly come, when the people must be permitted
in this matter to represent themselves; and there is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
one thing sure,&ndash;&ndash;the struggle may be protracted, but the
issue is certain. Important, however, as are our parish
schools, and rich in associations so intimately linked to the
intellectual glory of the nation, that, were they but mere
relics of the past, the custodiership of them might well be
most desirable to the Scottish people, they represent but a
small part of the stake involved in the present all-engrossing
movement. It seeks also to provide from the coffers of
the State&ndash;&ndash;on a broad basis of popular representation, and
with the reservation of a right on the part of the people
to supplement whatever instruction the State may not or
cannot supply&ndash;&ndash;that fearful educational destitution of the
nation which is sinking its tens and hundreds of thousands
into abject pauperism and barbarous ignorance, and which
neither Churches nor Societies can of themselves supply.
It is the <i>first</i> hopeful movement of the age; for our own
Free Church educational movement, though perhaps <i>second</i>
in point of importance, only serves irrefragably to demonstrate
its necessity.</p>
<p>It is, we repeat, to the people of Scotland, and not to
any one of the Churches of Scotland, that our scheme of
a widely-based and truly popular franchise would restore
the Scottish schools. Mr. George Combe is, however,
quite in the right in holding that religion is too intimately
associated with the educational question, and too decidedly
a force in the country, to be excluded from the national
seminaries, &#8216;unless, indeed, Government do something
more than merely <i>omit</i> the religious element.&#8217;<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> All is lost,
Mr. Combe justly infers, on the non-religious side of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
question, if the introduction of the Bible and Shorter Catechism
be not <i>prohibited</i> by Act of Parliament; for, if not
stringently prohibited, what Parliament merely omits doing,
a Bible and Catechism loving people will to a certainty do;
and the conscience of the phrenologist and his followers will
not fail to be outraged by the spectacle of Bible classes in
the national schools, and of State schoolmasters instilling
into the youthful mind, by means of the Shorter Catechism,
the doctrine of original sin and the work of the Spirit.
Nay, more; as it is not in the power of mere Acts of the
Legislature to eradicate from the hearts of a people those
feelings of partiality, based on deep religious conviction
and the associations of ages, with which it is natural to
regard a co-religionist, more especially in the case of the
teacher to whom one&#8217;s children are to read their daily
chapter and repeat their weekly tale of questions, <i>denomination</i>
must and will continue to exert its powerful influence
in the election of national schoolmasters popularly
chosen. And as there are certain extensive districts in
Scotland in which some one Church is the stronger, and
other certain districts in which some other Church is the
stronger, there are whole shires and provinces in which,
if selected on the popular scheme, the national teachers
would be found well-nigh all of one religious denomination.
From John O&#8217;Groat&#8217;s to Beauly, for instance, they would
be all, or almost all, Free Churchmen; for in that extensive
district almost all the people are Free Church. In the
Scottish Highlands generally, nearly the same result would
be produced, from, of course, the existence of a similar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
constituency. In Inverness, and onwards along the sea-coast
to Aberdeen, Montrose, St. Andrews, and the Frith
of Forth, the element of old dissent would be influentially
felt: the great parties among the people would be three&ndash;&ndash;Establishment,
Free Church, and Voluntary; and whichever
two of them united, would succeed in defeating the
third. And such unions, no doubt, frequently <i>would</i> take
place. The Voluntaries and Free Churchmen would often
unite for the carrying of a <i>man</i>; and occasionally, no doubt,
the Free Church and the Establishment, for the carrying of
a <i>principle</i>,&ndash;&ndash;that principle of religious teaching on which,
in the coming struggle, the State Church will be necessitated
to take her stand. To the south of the Frith of
Forth on to Berwick, and along the western coast from
Dumbarton to the Solway, there would be localities parcelled
out into large farms, in which the Establishment
would prevail; and of course, wherever it can reckon up
a majority of the more solid people, it is but right and
proper that the Establishment <i>should</i> prevail; but who can
doubt that even in these districts the national teaching
would be immensely heightened by a scheme which gave
to parents and ratepayers the selection of their teachers,
and restricted their choice to intelligent and qualified men?
Wherever there is liberty, there will be discussion and difference;
and the election of a schoolmaster would not be
managed quite as quietly under the anticipated state of
things, with the whole people of a parish for his constituency,
as in the present, by a minister and factor over a
social glass. But the objection taken by anticipation to
popular heats and contendings in such cases is as old as
the first stirrings of a free spirit among the people, and the
first struggles of despotism to bind them down. We ourselves
have heard it twice urged on the unpopular side,&ndash;&ndash;once
when the rotten burghs were nodding to their fall,
and once when an unrestricted patronage was imperilled by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
the encroachments of the Veto. There will, and must be,
difference; and difference too, Scotland being what it is,
in which the religious element will not fail to mingle; but
not the less completely on that account will the scheme
restore the Scottish schools to the Scottish people, as represented
by the majority, and to the membership of the Free
Church, in the <i>de facto</i> statistical sense and proportion in
which the Free Church is national. It will not restore
them to us in the theoretic sense; but then there are at
least three other true original Churches of Scotland, which
in that respect will be greatly worse off than ourselves,&ndash;&ndash;the
true national Cameronian Church, the true national
Episcopalian Church, and a true compact little Church of
the whole nation, that, in the form of one very excellent
minister, labours in the east.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we would fain say to our country folk and
readers of the north of Scotland: You, of all the Free
Churchmen of the kingdom, have an especial stake in this
matter. Examine for yourselves,&ndash;&ndash;trust to your own good
sense,&ndash;&ndash;exercise as Protestants your right of private judgment,&ndash;&ndash;and
see whether, as Christian men and good
Scotchmen, you may not fairly employ the political influence
given you by God and your country, in possessing
yourselves of the parish schools. There will be deep points
mooted in this controversy, which neither you nor we will
ever be in the least able to understand. You will no doubt
be told of a theocratic theory of the British Government,
perfectly compatible, somehow, with the receipt of educational
<i>grants</i> from which all recognition of the religious
element on the part of the State is, at the express request
of the Church, to be thoroughly discharged, but not at all
compatible with the receipt of an educational <i>endowment</i>
of exactly the same character, from which the same State
recognition of the same religious element is to be discharged
in the same degree. You will, we say, not be able
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
to understand this. The late Dr. Thomas Chalmers and
the late Rev. Mr. Stewart of Cromarty could not understand
it; we question much whether Dr. William Cunningham
understands it; and we are quite sure that Dr. Guthrie
and Dr. Begg do not. And you, who are poor simple
laymen, will never be able to understand it at all. But you
are all able to understand that the parish schools of your
respective districts, now lying empty and useless, belong of
right to you; and that it would be a very excellent thing
to have that right restored to you, both on your own behalf
and on that of your children.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER FOURTH.</h3>
<p class="ch_summary" >Objections urged by the Free Church Presbytery of Glasgow against the Educational
Movement&ndash;&ndash;Equally suited to bear against the Scheme of Educational Grants&ndash;&ndash;Great
superiority of Territorial over Denominational Endowment&ndash;&ndash;The Scottish
People sound as a whole, but some of the Scottish Sects very unsound&ndash;&ndash;State of
the Free Church Educational Scheme.</p>
<p>&#8216;Whereas attempts are now being made to reform the
parish schools of Scotland, on the principle of altogether
excluding religion from national recognition as an element
in the national system of education, and leaving it solely to
private parties to determine in each locality whether any
or what religious instruction will be introduced into the
parochial schools,&ndash;&ndash;it is humbly overtured to the Venerable
the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland, to
declare that this Church can be no party to any plan of
education based on the negation of religion in the general,
or of the national faith in particular,&#8217; etc.</p>
<p>Such is the gist of that &#8216;Overture on Education&#8217; which
was carried some three weeks ago by a majority of the Free
Church Presbytery of Glasgow. It has the merit of being
a clear enunciation of meaning; of being also at least as
well fitted to express the views of the Established as of the
Free Church courts in Glasgow and elsewhere, and a great
deal better suited to serve as a cloak to their policy; and,
further, by a very slight adaptation, it could be made to
bear as directly against State <i>grants</i> given for educational
purposes, if dissociated from the religious certificate, as
against State <i>endowments</i> given for the same purpose, when
dissociated from statutory religious requirement. It is the
religious certificate&ndash;&ndash;most anomalously demanded of denominations
diametrically opposed to each other in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
beliefs, and subversive of each other in their teachings&ndash;&ndash;that
constitutes in the affair of educational grants the recognition
of religion on the part of the State. Educational
grants dissociated from the religious certificate are
educational grants dissociated from the State recognition of
religion. The fact that the certificates demanded should
be of so anomalous a character, is simply a reflection of the
all-important fact that the British people are broken up into
antagonistic Churches and hostile denominations, and that
the British Government is representative. And that men
such as those members and office-bearers of our Church
who hold the middle position between that occupied by
Mr. Gibson of Glasgow on the one hand, and Dr. Begg of
Edinburgh on the other, should see no other way of availing
themselves of the educational grants, with a good conscience,
than by getting rid of the religious recognition,
only serves to show that they are quite as sensible as their
opponents in the liberal section of the enormous difficulty
of the case, and can bethink themselves of no better mode
of unlocking it. For it will not be contended, that if in
the matter of grants there is to be no recognition of religion
on the part of the State, the want of it could be more
adequately supplied by sects, as such, denominationally
divided, than by the people of Scotland, as such, territorially
divided; seeing that sects, as such, include Papists,
Puseyites, Socinians, and Seceders,&ndash;&ndash;Muggletonians, Juggletonians,
New Jerusalemites, and United Presbyterians,&ndash;&ndash;Free-thinking
Christians, Free-Willers, and Free Churchmen.
Nor can we see either the wisdom or the advantage
of any scheme of Government inquiry into the educational
destitution of a locality, that, instead of supplying the want
which it found, would merely placard the place by a sort of
feuing ticket&ndash;&ndash;destined, we are afraid, in many instances
to be sadly weather-bleached&ndash;&ndash;which would intimate to the
sects in general, that were any one of them to come forward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
and enact the part of school-builder and pedagogue,
the State would undertake for a portion of the expenses.
We suppose the advertisement on the ticket would run
somewhat as follows:&ndash;&ndash;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>&#8216;Wanted by the Government, A
Church to erect a School. Terms Liberal, and no
Certificate of Religious Teaching demanded. <i>N.B.</i>&ndash;&ndash;Papists,
Puseyites, and Socinians perfectly eligible.&#8217;</span><a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a></p>
<p>Leaving, however, to profounder intellects than our own
the adjustment of the nice principles involved in this matter,
let us advert to what we deem the practical advantages of
a <i>territorial</i> scheme of educational <i>endowments</i> over a <i>denominational</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
scheme of educational <i>grants</i>. At present, all
or any of the <i>sects</i> may come forward as such, whatever
their character or teaching, and, on fulfilling certain conditions,
receive assistance from the Government in the form
of an educational grant; whereas, by the scheme which we
would fain see set in its place, it would be only the more
solid people of <i>districts</i>&ndash;&ndash;let us suppose parishes&ndash;&ndash;that
would be qualified to come forward to choose for themselves
their parochial State-endowed teachers. And at least
one of the advantages of this scheme over the other must be
surely obvious and plain. <i>Denominationally</i>, there is much
unsoundness in Scotland; <i>territorially</i>, there is very little.
There exist, unhappily, differences among our Scottish
Presbyterians; but not the less on that account has Presbyterianism,
in its three great divisions&ndash;&ndash;Voluntary, Establishment,
and Free Church&ndash;&ndash;possessed itself of the land in
all its length and breadth. The only other form of religion
that has a territorial existence in Scotland at all is Popery,
and Popery holds merely a few darkened districts of the
outer Hebrides and of the Highlands. It would fail, out of
the one thousand one hundred parish schools of the country,
to carry half-a-dozen; and no other form of religious error
would succeed in carrying so much as one parish school.
There is no Socinian district in Scotland; old Scotch
Episcopacy has not its single parish; and high Puseyism
has not its half, or quarter, or even tithe of a parish. That
Church of Scotland which Knox founded, with its offshoots
the Secession and Relief bodies, has not laboured in
vain; and through the blessing of God on these labours,
Scotland, as represented by its territorial majorities, is by
far the soundest and most orthodox country in the world.
A wise and patriotic man&ndash;&ndash;at once a good Scot and a
judicious Churchman&ndash;&ndash;would, we think, hesitate long ere
he flung away so solid an advantage, won to us by the
labours, the contendings, the sufferings of reformers, confessors,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
martyrs, and ministers of the truth, from the days
of Melville and of Henderson, down to those of the
Erskines and of Chalmers. He would at least not fail to
ask himself whether that to which what was so unequivocally
<i>substance</i> was to be sacrificed, was in itself <i>substance</i>
or <i>shadow</i>.</p>
<p>Let us next remark, that the Scottish national schools,
while they thus could not fail to be essentially sound on
the territorial scheme&ndash;&ndash;just because Scotland is itself essentially
sound as a nation&ndash;&ndash;might, and would in very many
instances, be essentially unsound on a denominational one.
There is no form of religious error which may not, in the
present state of things, have, as we have said, its schools
supported in part by a Government grant, and which may
not have its pupil-teachers trained up to disseminate deadly
error at the public expense among the youthhead of the
future. Edinburgh, for instance, has its one Popish street&ndash;&ndash;the
Cowgate; but it has no Popish parish: it has got
very little Popery in George Square and its neighbourhood,&ndash;&ndash;very
little at the Bristo Port,&ndash;&ndash;very little in Broughton
Street; and yet in all these localities, territorially Protestant,
Papists have got their religion-teaching schools, in
which pupil-teachers, paid by the State, are in the course
of being duly qualified for carrying on the work of perversion
and proselytism. St. Patrick&#8217;s school, in which, as
our readers were so lately shown, boys may spend four
years without acquiring even the simple accomplishment of
reading, has no fewer than five of these embryo perverters
supported by the Government. Puseyism has, in the same
way, no territorial standing on the northern shores of the
Frith of Forth; and yet at least one Free Church minister,
located in one of the towns which stud that coast, could
tell of a well-equipped Puseyite school in his immediate
neighbourhood, supported in part by the Government grant,
that, by the superiority of the secular education which it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
supplies, is drawing away Presbyterian, nay, even Free
Church children, from the other schools of the locality.
On the territorial principle, we repeat, schools such as
these, which rest on the denominational basis alone, could
not possibly receive the support and countenance of the
Legislature. And let the reader remark, that should the
Free Church succeed in getting rid of the anomalous religious
certificate, and yet continue to hold by the denominational
basis, something worse than mere denomination would
scarce fail to step in. The Combeite might then freely
come forward to teach at the public expense, that no other
soul of man has yet been ascertained to exist than the
human brain, and no other superintending Providence than
the blind laws of insensate matter. Nay, even Socialism,
just a little disguised, might begin to build and teach for
the benefit of the young, secure of being backed and assisted
in its work by the civil magistrate. Further, should the
grant scheme be rendered more flexible, <i>i.e.</i> extended to a
lower grade of qualification, and thus the public purse be
applied to the maintenance and perpetuation of a hedge-school
system of education,&ndash;&ndash;or should it be rendered more
liberal, <i>i.e.</i> should the Government be induced to do proportionally
more, and the school-builders be required to do
proportionally less,&ndash;&ndash;superstition and infidelity would, in
the carrying out of their schemes of perversion, have, in
consequence, just all the less to sacrifice and to acquire.
According to the present arrangement, a schoolmaster must
realize, from salary and fees united, the sum of forty-five
annual pounds, and be, besides, furnished with a free
house, ere he can receive from the Government a grant on
its lowest scale, viz. fifteen pounds;<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> and whatever judgment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
may be formed of the proportion in which the State
contributes, there can be no question that the general
arrangement is a wise one. Sermonizing dominies could
be had, no doubt, at any price; and there can be as little
doubt that, at any price, would the great bulk of them turn
out to be &#8216;<i>doons hard bargains</i>;&#8217; but it is wholly impossible
that a country should have respectable and efficient teachers
under from sixty to eighty pounds a year. The thing, we
repeat, is wholly impossible; and the State, in acting, as in
this arrangement, on the conviction, does but its duty to
its people. The some sixty or seventy pounds, however,
would be as certainly realized as under the present arrangement,
were it Government that contributed the forty-five
pounds, and the denomination or society the fifteen and
the free house; and this, of course, would be eminently
liberal. But what would be the effects of so happy a
change? It might in some degree relieve the Free Church
Scheme from financial difficulty; but would it do nothing
more? There are Puseyite ladies in Scotland, high in rank
and influence, and possessed of much wealth and great
zeal, who are already building their schools, in the hope of
unprotestantizing their poor lapsed country, spiritually ruined
by the Reformation. The liberality that might in part
enable the Free Church Education Committee to discharge
its obligations at the rate of twenty shillings per pound,
would be a wonderful godsend to them; seeing that they
would have little else to do, under a scheme so liberal, than
simply to erect schoolhouses on the widespread domains
of their husbands or fathers, and immediately commence
perverting the children of the nation at the national cost.
It would be no less advantageous to the Society of the
Propaganda, and would enable it to spare its own purse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
by opening to it that of the people. The Socinian, the
Combeite, the semi-Socialist&ndash;&ndash;none of them very much disposed
to liberality themselves&ndash;&ndash;would all share in that of
the Government; and their zeal, no longer tied down to
inactivity by the dread of pecuniary sacrifice or obligation,
would find wings and come abroad. Surely, with such
consequences in prospect, our Free Church readers would
do well to ponder the nature and demands of the crisis at
which they have now arrived. Our country and our Church
have in reality but one set of interests; and a man cannot
be a bad Scot without being a bad Free Churchman too.
Let them decide in this matter, not under the guidance of
an oblique eye, squinted on little temporary difficulties or
hypothetical denominational advantages, but influenced by
considerations of the permanent welfare of their country,
and of their abiding obligations to their God.</p>
<p>But why, it may be asked of the writer, if you be thus
sensible of the immense superiority of a territorial scheme
of educational endowments over a denominational scheme
of educational grants,&ndash;&ndash;why did you yourself urge, some
three years ago, that the Free Church should avail herself
of these very grants? Our reply is sufficiently simple.
The denominational scheme of grants was the only scheme
before us at the time; these grants were, we saw, in danger
of being rejected by the Free Church on what we deemed
an unsound and perilous principle, which was in itself in no
degree Free Church; and last, not least, we saw further, that
if the Church did not avail herself of these grants, there
awaited on her Educational Scheme&ndash;&ndash;ominously devoid
of that direct divine mandate which all her other schemes
possessed&ndash;&ndash;inevitable and disastrous bankruptcy. But
circumstances have greatly changed. The Free Church is
no longer in any danger from the principle which would
have rejected Government assistance. There is now a
territorial scheme brought full before the view of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
country; and, further, the Government grants have wholly
failed to preserve our Educational Scheme from the state
of extreme pecuniary embarrassment which we too surely
anticipated. Salaries of &pound;15 and &pound;20 per annum are
greatly less than adequate for the support and remuneration
of even the lower order of teachers, especially in thinly-peopled
districts of country, where pupils are few and the
fees inconsiderable. But at these low rates it was determined,
in the programme of the Free Church Educational
Scheme, that about three-fourths of the Church&#8217;s teachers
should be paid; and there are scores and hundreds among
them who regulated their expenditure on the arrangement.
For at least the last two years, however, the Education
Committee has been paying its &pound;15 salaries at the reduced
rate of &pound;10, and its &pound;20 salaries at the rate of &pound;13, 13s.
4d.; and those embarrassments, of which the reduction
was a consequence, have borne with distressful effect on
the Committee&#8217;s <i>employ&eacute;s</i>. However <i>orthodox</i> their creed,
their circumstances have in many instances become <i>Antinomian</i>;
nor, while teaching religion to others, have they
been able in every instance to conform to one of its simplest
demands&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Owe no man anything.&#8217;</p>
<p>There were several important items, let us remark, in
which we over-estimated the amount of assistance which
the Scheme was to receive from the Government; and
this mainly from our looking at the matter in the gross, as
a question of proportion&ndash;&ndash;so much granted for so much
raised&ndash;&ndash;without taking into account certain conditions demanded
by the Minutes of Council on the one hand, and a
certain course of management adopted on the part of our
Education Committee on the other. The grant is given in
proportion to salary of one to two (we at present set aside
the element of fees): a <i>salary</i> of thirty pounds is supplemented
by a <i>grant</i> of fifteen pounds,&ndash;&ndash;a salary of forty
pounds by a grant of twenty,&ndash;&ndash;a salary of fifty by a grant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
of twenty-five,&ndash;&ndash;and so on; and we were sanguine enough
to calculate, that an aggregate sum of some ten or twelve
thousand pounds raised by the Church for salaries, would
be supplemented by an aggregation of grants from the
Government to the amount of some five or six thousand
pounds more. The minimum sum regarded as essentially
necessary for carrying on the Free Church Educational
Scheme had been estimated at twenty thousand pounds.
If the Free Church raise but twelve thousand of these, we
said, Government will give her six thousand additional in
the form of grants, and some two thousand additional, or
so, for the training of her pupil-teachers; and the Church
will thus be enabled to realize her minimum estimate. We
did not take the fact into account, that of our Free Church
teachers a preponderating majority should fail successfully
to compete for the Government money; nor yet that the
educational funds should be so broken up into driblet
salaries, attached to schools in which the fees were poor
and the pupils few, that the schoolmaster, even though
possessed of the necessary <i>literary</i> qualification, would in
many cases be some twenty, or even thirty, pounds short of
the necessary <i>money</i> qualification, <i>i.e.</i> the essential forty-five
annual pounds. We did not, we say, take these circumstances
into account,&ndash;&ndash;indeed, it was scarce possible that
we could have done so; and so we immensely over-estimated
the efficacy of the State grant in maintaining the
solvency of our Educational Scheme. We learn from Dr.
Reid&#8217;s recent Report to our metropolitan church court,
that of the forty-two Free Church teachers connected with
the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and in receipt of salaries from
the Education Committee, only thirteen have been successful
in obtaining Government certificates of merit. And
even this is a rather high average, compared with that of
the other districts; for we have ascertained, that of the six
hundred and eighty-nine teachers of the Free Church scattered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
over the kingdom, not more than a hundred and
twenty-nine have received the Government grant. There
are, however, among the others, teachers who have failed
to attain to it, not from any want of the literary qualification&ndash;&ndash;for
some of them actually possess the parchment
certificate bearing the signature of Lansdowne&ndash;&ndash;but simply
because they are unfortunate enough to lack the pecuniary
one.</p>
<p>That which we so much dreaded has come, we repeat,
upon our Educational Scheme. The subject is a painfully
delicate one, and we have long kept aloof from it; but
truth, and truth only, can now enable the Free Church
and her people to act, in this emergency, as becomes the
character which they bear, and the circumstances in which
they are placed. Let us not fall into the delusion of deeming
the mere array of our Free Church schools and teachers&ndash;&ndash;their
numbers and formidable length of line&ndash;&ndash;any matter
of congratulation; nor forget, in our future calculations,
that if the Free Church now realizes from &pound;10,000 to
&pound;12,000 yearly for educational purposes, she would require
to realize some &pound;5000 or &pound;6000 more in order to qualify
her to meet her existing liabilities, estimated at the very
moderate rates laid down in the programme. The &pound;5000
or &pound;6000 additional, instead of enabling her to erect a
single additional school, would only enable her to pay in
full her teachers&#8217; salaries. And so it is obviously a delusion
to hold that our Free Church Educational Scheme supplies
in reality two-thirds of our congregations with teachers,
seeing that these teachers are only two-thirds paid. We
are still some &pound;5000 or &pound;6000 short of supplying the two-thirds,
and some &pound;6000 or &pound;7000 more of supplying the
whole. And even were the whole of our own membership
to be supplied, the grand query, How is our country to be
educated,&ndash;&ndash;our parish schools to be restored to usefulness
and the Scotch people,&ndash;&ndash;and Scotland herself to resume
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
and maintain her old place among the nations?&ndash;&ndash;would
come back upon us as emphatically as now. Judging from
what has been already done, and this after every nerve has
been strained in the Sisyphisian work of rolling up-hill an
ever-returning stone, it seems wholly impossible that we
should ever succeed in educating the young of even our
own congregations; and how, then, save on some great
national scheme, is a sinking nation to be educated?</p>

<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER FIFTH.</h3>
<p class="ch_summary" >Unskilled Labourers remunerated at a higher rate than many of our Free Church
Teachers&ndash;&ndash;The Teaching must be inferior if the Remuneration be low&ndash;&ndash;Effect
of inferior Teaching on the parties taught&ndash;&ndash;Statutory Security; where are the
parties to contend for it?&ndash;&ndash;Necessity of a Government Inquiry&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;O for an hour
of Knox!&#8217;</p>
<p>That higher order of farm-servants which are known technically
in Mid-Lothian as &#8216;sowers and stackers,&#8217; receive, as
their yearly wages, in the immediate neighbourhood of the
house of the writer, eighteen pounds in money, four bolls
oatmeal, two cart-loads of potatoes, and about from twenty
to thirty shillings worth of milk. The money value of the
whole amounts, at the present time, to something between
twenty-three and twenty-four pounds sterling. We are informed
by a Fifeshire proprietor, that in his part of the
country, a superior farm-servant, neither grieve nor foreman,
receives eight pounds in money, six and a half bolls meal,
three cart-loads of potatoes, and the use of a cow, generally
estimated as worth from ten to twelve pounds annually.
His aggregate wages, therefore, average from about twenty-four
to twenty-six pounds ten shillings a year. And we are
told by another proprietor of the south of Scotland, that
each of the better hinds in his employment costs him every
year about thirty pounds. In fine, to the south of the
Grampians, the emoluments of our more efficient class of
farm-servants range from twenty-three to thirty pounds
yearly. We need not refer to the wages of railway navvies,
nor yet to those of the superior classes of mechanics, such
as printers, masons, jewellers, typefounders, etc. There is
not a printer in the <i>Witness</i> office who would be permitted
by the rules of his profession, to make an arrangement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
with his employers, were he to exchange piece-work for
wages, that did not secure to him twenty-five shillings per
week. To expect that a country or Church can possibly
have efficient schoolmasters at a lower rate of emolument
than not only skilled mechanics, but than even unskilled
railway labourers, or the &#8216;stackers and sowers&#8217; of our large
farms, is so palpably a delusion, that simply to name it is to
expose it. And yet of our Free Church schoolmasters,
especially in thinly-peopled rural districts and the Highlands,
there are scores remunerated at a lower rate than
labourers and farm-servants, and hundreds at a rate at least
as low; and if we except the fortunate hundred and twenty-nine
who receive the Government grant, few indeed of the
others rise to the level of the skilled mechanic. Greatly
more than two-thirds of our teachers were placed originally
on the &pound;15 and &pound;20 scale of salaries: these are now paid
with &pound;10 and &pound;13, 13s. 4d. respectively. There are many
localities in which these pittances are not more than doubled
by the fees, and some localities in which they are even less
than doubled; and so a preponderating majority of the
schoolmasters of the Free Church are miserably poor men:
for what might be a competency to a labourer or hind, must
be utter poverty to them. And not a few of their number
are distressfully embarrassed and in debt.</p>
<p>Now this will never do. The Church may make herself
very sure, that for her &pound;10 or &pound;13 she will receive ultimately
only the worth of &pound;10 or &pound;13. She may get windfalls
of single teachers for a few months or years: superior
young men may occasionally make a brief stay in her
schools, in the course of their progress to something better,&ndash;&ndash;as
Pilgrim rested for a while in the half-way recess hollowed
in the side of the Hill Difficulty; but only very
mediocre men, devoid of energy enough of body or mind
to make good masons or carpenters, will stick fast in them.
We have learned that, in one northern locality, no fewer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
than eight Free Church teachers have since Martinmas last
either tendered their resignations, or are on the eve of
doing so. These, it will be found, are superior men, who
rationally aspire to something better than mere ploughman&#8217;s
wages; but there will of course be no resignations tendered
by the class who, in even the lowest depths of the Scheme,
have found but their proper level. These, as the more
active spirits fly off, will flow in and fill up their places, till,
wherever the &pound;10 and &pound;13 salaries prevail,&ndash;&ndash;and in what
rural district do they not prevail?&ndash;&ndash;the general pedagogical
acquirements of our teachers will present a surface as flat,
dull, and unprofitable as ditch-water. For what, we again
ask, can be expected for &pound;10 or &pound;13? And let the
reader but mark the effect of such teaching. We have seen
placed side by side, in the same burgh town, an English
school, in which what are deemed the branches suitable for
mechanics and their children, such as reading, writing, and
arithmetic, were energetically taught, and a grammar school
in which a university-bred schoolmaster laboured, with
really not much energy, especially in those lower departments
in which his rival excelled, but who was fitted to
prepare his pupils for college, and not devoid of the classical
enthusiasm. And it struck us as a significant and instructive
fact, that while the good English school, though it
turned out smart readers and clever arithmeticians, failed to
elevate a single man from the lower to the middle or higher
walks of life, the grammar school was successful in elevating
a great many. The principle on which such a difference of
result should have been obtained is so obvious, that it can
scarce be necessary to point it out. The teaching of the
one school was a narrow lane, trim, &#8217;tis true, and well kept,
but which led to only workshops, brick-kilns, and quarries;
whereas that of the other was a broad, partially-neglected
avenue, which opened into the great professional highways,
that lead everywhere. And if the difference was one which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
could not be obviated by all the energy of a superior and
well-paid English teacher, how, we ask, is it to be obviated
by our Free Church &pound;10 and &pound;13 teachers? Surely our
Church would do well to ponder whether it can be either
her interest or her duty to urge on any scheme, in opposition
to a national one, which would have all too palpably
the effect of degrading her poorer membership, so far as
they availed themselves of it, into the Gibeonites of the
community&ndash;&ndash;its hewers of wood and drawers of water.
Never will Scotland possess an educational scheme truly
national, and either worthy of her ancient fame or adequate
to the demands and emergencies of an age like the present,
until at least every parish shall possess among its other
teachers its one university-bred schoolmaster, popularly
chosen, and well paid, and suited to assist in transplanting
to the higher places of society those select and vigorous
scions that from time to time spring up from the stock of
the commonalty. The waking dream of running down the
ignorance and misery of a sinking country by an array of
starveling teachers in the train of any one denomination&ndash;&ndash;itself,
mayhap, sufficiently attenuated by the demands of
purely ecclesiastical objects&ndash;&ndash;must be likened to that other
waking dream of the belated German peasant, who sees
from some deep glade of his native forests a spectral hunt
sweep through the clouds,&ndash;&ndash;skeleton stags pursued by
skeleton huntsmen, mounted on skeleton horses, and surrounded
by skeleton beagles; and who hears, as the wild
pageant recedes into the darkness, the hollow tantivy and
the spectral horns echoing loud and wildly through the
angry heavens.</p>
<p>It is of paramount importance that the Free Church
should in the present crisis take up her position wisely.
We have heard of invaders of desperate courage, who, on
landing upon some shore on which they had determined
either to conquer or to perish, set fire to their ships, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
thus shut out the possibility of retreat. Now the Free
Church&ndash;&ndash;whether she land herself into an agitation for a
scheme of Government grants rendered more liberal and
flexible than now, and dissociated from the religious certificate,
or whether she plant her foot on a scheme of national
education based on a statutory recognition of the pedagogical
teaching of religion&ndash;&ndash;is certainly in no condition to
burn her ships. Let her not rashly commit herself against
a third scheme, essentially one in principle with that which
the sagacious Chalmers could regard, after long and profound
reflection, as the only one truly eligible in the circumstances
of the country, and which she herself, some two
or three years hence, may be compelled to regard in a
similar light. The educational agitation is not to be settled
in the course of a few brief months; nor yet by the votes
of Presbyteries, Synods, or General Assemblies, whether
they belong to the Free or to the Established Churches.
It rises direct out of the great social question of the time.
Scotland as such forms one of its battle-fields, and Scotchmen
as such are the parties who are to be engaged in
the fight; and the issue, though ultimately secure, will long
seem doubtful. And so the Free Church may have quite
time enough to fight her own battle, or rather her own <i>two</i>
battles in succession, and, when both are over, find that
the great general contest still remains undecided.</p>
<p>For what we must deem by much the better and more
important battle of the <i>two</i>&ndash;&ndash;that for a statutory demand
on the part of the State that the Bible and Shorter Catechism
should be taught in the national schools&ndash;&ndash;we are
afraid the time is past; but most happy would we be to
find ourselves mistaken. The Church of Scotland, as represented
by that majority which is now the Free Church,
might have succeeded in carrying some such measure ten
years ago, when the parish schools were yet in her custody;
just as she might have succeeded seven years earlier in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
obviating the dire necessity which led to the Disruption,
by acting upon the advice of the wise and far-seeing M&#8217;Crie.<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a>
But she was not less prepared at the one date to agitate for
the total abolition of patronage, than at the other to throw
open the parish schools on the basis of a statutory security
for the teaching of religion. In both cases, the golden
opportunity was suffered to pass by; and Old Time presents
to her now but the bald retreating occiput, which her
eager hand may in vain attempt to grasp. Where, we ask,
are we to look for the forces that are to assist us in fighting
this battle of statutory security? Has the Establishment
become more liberal, or more disposed to open the parish
schools, than we ourselves were when we composed the
majority of that very Establishment? Alas! in order to
satisfy ourselves on that head, we have but to look at the
decisions of her various ecclesiastical courts. Or is it the
old Scottish Dissenters that are to change their entire
front, and to make common cause with us, in disregard,
and even in defiance, of their own principles, as they themselves
understand them? Or are we to look to that evangelical
portion of the Episcopacy of England, with whom
<i>Establishment</i> means <i>Church</i>, and the &#8216;good of the Establishment&#8217;
a synonyme for the &#8216;good of the Church,&#8217; and
who, to a certainty, will move no hand against the sister
Establishment in Scotland? Or are we to be aided by that
portion of English Independency that has so very strangely
taken its stand equally against educational grants and educational
endowments, on the ground that there is a sort of
religion hom&oelig;opathically diffused in all education&ndash;&ndash;especially,
we suppose, in Lindley Murray&#8217;s readings from the
<i>Spectator</i> and Dr. Blair&ndash;&ndash;and that, as the State must not
provide <i>religious</i> teaching for its people, it cannot, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
must not, provide for them teaching of any kind? Scientific
Jews are they, of the straitest sect, who, wiser than their
fathers, have ascertained by the microscope, that all meat,
however nicely washed, continues to retain its molecules of
blood, and that flesh therefore must on no account be
eaten. We cannot, we say, discern, within the wide horizon
of existing realities, the troops with which this battle
is to be fought. They seem to be mere shadows of the
past. But if the Free Church see otherwise, let her by all
means summon them up, and fight it. Regarded simply as
a matter of policy, we are afraid the contest would be at
least imprudent. &#8216;It were well,&#8217; said a Scotch officer to
Wolfe, when Chatham first called out the Highlanders of
Scotland to fight in the wars of Britain,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;It were well,
General, that you should know the character of these Highland
troops. Do not attempt man&oelig;uvring with them;
Scotch Highlanders don&#8217;t understand man&oelig;uvre. If you
make a feint of charging, they will throw themselves sword
in hand into the thick of the enemy, and you will in vain
attempt calling them back; or if you make a show of retreating,
they will run away in right earnest, and you will
never see them more. So do not employ them in feints
and stratagems, but keep them for the hard, serious business
of the fight, and you will find them the best troops
in the world.&#8217; Now, nearly the same character applies to
the Free Church. To set her a-fighting as a matter of
policy, would be very bad policy indeed. She would find
out reasons, semi-theological at least, for all her positions,
however hopeless, and would continue fixed in these long
after the battle had been fought and lost, and when she
ought to be engaged in retrieving her disasters on other
ground, and in a fresh and more promising quarrel. But
if the Free Church does enter into this battle, let her in
the meantime not forget, that after it has been fought,
and at least <i>possibly</i> lost, another battle may have still to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
be begun; nor let her attempt damaging, by doubtful
theology, the position which a preponderating majority of
her own office-bearers and members may have yet to take
up. For, ultimately at least, the damage would be all her
own. Let her remark further, that should her people set
their hearts pretty strongly on those national seminaries,
which in many parts of the country would become, if
opened up, wholly their own <i>de facto</i>, and which are already
their own <i>de jure</i>, they might not be quite able to feel the
cogency of the argument that, while it left Socinians and
Papists in the enjoyment of at once very liberal and very
flexible Government grants, challenged <i>their</i> right to choose,
on their own responsibility, State-paid teachers for their
children; and which virtually assured them, that if they did
not contribute largely to the educational scheme of their own
Church, she would be wholly unable to maintain it as a
sort of mid-impediment between them and their just rights,
the parish schools. They would be exceedingly apt, too,
to translate any very determined and general preference
manifested by our church courts for the scheme of educational
grants, into some such enunciation as the following:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Give
us to ourselves but a moiety of one-third of the
Scottish young, and we will frankly give up the other two-thirds,&ndash;&ndash;the
one-half of them to be destroyed by gross
ignorance, and the other half by deadly error.&#8217;<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a></p>
<p>There is at least one point on which we think all Free
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
Churchmen ought to agree. It is necessary that the truth
should be known respecting the educational condition and
resources of Scotland. It will, we understand, be moved
to-day [February 27th], in the Free Church Presbytery of
Edinburgh, as a thing good and desirable, that Government
should &#8216;institute an inquiry into the educational destitution
confessedly existing in large towns, populous neighbourhoods,
and remote districts, with a view to the marking out
of places where elementary schools are particularly needed,&#8217;
etc. Would it not be more satisfactory to move instead,
the desirableness of a Government Commission of Inquiry,
1<i>st</i>, into the educational condition of all the youth of
Scotland between the years of six and fifteen, on the
scheme of that inquiry recently conducted by a Free Church
Educational Association in the Tron parish of Glasgow;
2<i>d</i>, into the condition, character, and teaching of all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
various schools of the country, whether parochial, Free
Church, or adventure schools, with the actual amount of
pupils in attendance at each; and 3<i>d</i>, into the general
standing, acquirements, and <i>emoluments</i> of all the teachers?
Not only would the report of such a Commission be of
much solid value in itself, from the amount of fact which
it would furnish for the direction of educational exertion
on the part of both the people and the State; but it might
also have the effect of preventing good men from taking up,
in the coming contest, untenable and suspicious ground.
It would lay open the true state of our parish schools,
and not only show how utterly useless these institutions
have become, from at least the shores of the Beauly to
those of the Pentland Frith, and throughout the Highlands
generally, but also expose the gross exaggeration of the
estimate furnished by Mr. Macrae, and adopted by Dr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
Muir.<a name='FNanchor_0011' id='FNanchor_0011'></a><a href='#Footnote_0011' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> Further, it would have the effect of preventing any
member of either the Free Church or the Establishment from
resorting to the detestable policy of those Dissenters of
England, who, in order to secure certain petty advantages
to their own miserable sects, set themselves to represent
their poor country&ndash;&ndash;perishing at the time for lack of knowledge&ndash;&ndash;as
comparatively little in need of educational assistance.
But we trust this at least is an enormity, at once
criminal and mean, of which no Scotchman, whatever his
Church, <i>could</i> possibly be guilty; and so we shall not do
our country the injustice of holding that, though it produced
its &#8216;fause Sir Johns&#8217; in the past, it contains in the
present one such traitor, until we at least see the man.
Further, a State Report of the kind would lay open to us,
in the severe statistical form, the actual emoluments of our
own Free Church teachers. We trust, then, that this
scheme of a searching Government inquiry may be regarded
as a first great step towards the important work of
educating the Scottish people, in which all ought to agree,
however thoroughly at variance in matters of principle or
on points of detail.</p>
<p>It is of mighty importance that men should look at things
as they really are. Let us remember that it is not for the
emergencies of yesterday that we are now called on to provide,
but for the necessities of to-day,&ndash;&ndash;not for Scotland in
the year 1592, nor yet in the year 1700, but for Scotland in
the year 1850. What might be the best possible course in
these bygone ages, may be, and is, wholly an impracticable
course now. <i>Church</i> at both these earlier dates meant not
only an orthodox communion, but also that preponderating
majority of the nation which reckoned up as its own the
great bulk of both the rulers and the ruled, and at once
owned the best and longest swords, and wore the strongest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
armour; whereas it now means, <i>legally</i> at least, merely two
Erastianized Establishments, and <i>politically</i>, all the Christian
denominations that possess votes and return members
to Parliament. The prism seizes on a single white ray, and
decomposes it into a definitely proportioned spectrum,
gorgeous with the primary colours. The representative
principle of a Government such as ours takes up, as if by a
reverse process, those diverse hues of the denominational
spectrum that vary the face of society, and compounds
them in the Legislature into a blank. Save for the existence
of the two Establishments&ndash;&ndash;strong on other than
religious grounds&ndash;&ndash;and the peculiar tinge which they cast
on the institutions of the country, the blank would be still
more perfect than it is; and this fact&ndash;&ndash;a direct result of
the strongly marked hues of the denominational spectrum,
operated upon by the representative principle&ndash;&ndash;we can no
more change than we can the optical law. Let there be
but the colour of one religion in the national spectrum,
and the Legislature will wear but one religious colour: let
it consist of half-a-dozen colours, and the Legislature will
be of none. &#8216;O for an hour of Knox!&#8217; it has been said by
a good and able man, from whom, however, in this question
we greatly differ,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;O for an hour of Knox to defend
the national religious education which he was raised up to
institute!&#8217; Knox, be it remembered, was wise, prudent,
sagacious, in accordance with the demands of his time. A
Knox of the exact fashion of the sixteenth century, raised
up in the middle of the nineteenth, would be but a slim,
long-bearded effigy of a Knox, grotesquely attired in a
Geneva cloak and cap, and with the straw and hay that
stuffed him sticking out in tufts from his waistband. &#8216;O for
an hour of Knox!&#8217; The Scottish Church of the present
age has already had its Knox. &#8216;Elias hath already come.&#8217;
The large-minded, wise-hearted Knox of the nineteenth
century died at Morningside three years ago; and he has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
bequeathed, as a precious legacy to the Church, his judgment
on this very question. &#8216;It were the best state of
things,&#8217; he said, &#8216;that we had a Parliament sufficiently theological
to discriminate between the right and the wrong in
religion, and to endow accordingly. But failing this, it
seems to us the next best thing, that in any public measure
for helping on the education of the people, Government
were to abstain from introducing the element of religion at
all into their part of the scheme; and this not because they
held the matter to be insignificant,&ndash;&ndash;the contrary might be
strongly expressed in the preamble of their Act,<a name='FNanchor_0012' id='FNanchor_0012'></a><a href='#Footnote_0012' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a>&ndash;&ndash;but on
the ground that, in the present divided state of the Christian
world, they would take no cognizance of, just because
they would attempt no control over, the religion of applicants
for aid,&ndash;&ndash;leaving this matter entire to the parties who
had to do with the erection and management of the schools
which they had been called upon to assist. A grant by the
State on this footing might be regarded as being appropriately
and exclusively the expression of their value for a
good secular education.&#8217;</p>

<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER SIXTH.</h3>
<p class="ch_summary" >Our previous Statement regarding the actual Condition of the Free Church Educational
Scheme absolutely necessary&ndash;&ndash;Voluntary Objections to a National Scheme,
as stated by the Opponents of the Voluntaries; not particularly solid&ndash;&ndash;Examination
of the matter.</p>
<p>Our episode regarding the Free Church Educational Scheme
now fairly completed, let us return to the general question.
The reader may, however, do well to note the inevitable
necessity which existed on our part, that our wholesome,
though mayhap unpalatable, statements respecting it should
have been submitted to the Church and the country. The
grand question which in the course of Providence had at
length arisen was, &#8216;How is our sinking country to be
educated?&#8217; We had taken our stand, as a Scotchman, in
behalf of the Scottish people; and as the belief seemed
widely to exist that our own Free Church scheme was
adequate, or at least nearly so, to the education of the children
of our own membership, and that our duty as Scotchmen
could be fulfilled, somehow, by concentrating all our
exertions upon <i>it</i>, it had become essentially necessary that
the delusion should be dispelled. And so we have showed,
that while our scheme, in order fully to supply the educational
wants of even our own people, would require to
exist in the proportion of <i>nine</i>, it exists nominally in but the
proportion of <i>six</i>, and in reality in but the proportion of
<i>four</i>,&ndash;&ndash;seeing that the <i>six, i.e</i>. our existing staff of teachers,
amounting to but two-thirds of the number required, are
but two-thirds paid;&ndash;&ndash;in short, that our educational speculation
is exactly in the circumstances of a railway company
who, having engaged to cut a line ninety miles in length, have
succeeded in cutting forty miles of it at their own proper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
expense, and then having cut twenty miles more on <i>preference</i>
shares, find their further progress arrested by a lack
of funds. And so it became necessary to show that the
existence and circumstances of our Free Church schools,
instead of furnishing, as had been urged in several of our
presbyteries, any argument <i>against</i> the agitation of the
general question, furnished, on the contrary, the best possible
of all arguments <i>for</i> its agitation; and to show further,
that the policy which brought a denominational scheme,
that did not look beyond ourselves, into a great national
engagement, in the character of a privateer virtually on
the side of the enemy, was a most perilous policy, that
exposed it to damaging broadsides, and telling shot right
between wind and water.</p>
<p>Let us now pass on to the consideration of a matter on
which we but touched before,&ndash;&ndash;the perfect compatibility of
a consistent Voluntaryism with religious teaching in a school
endowed by the State, on the principle of Dr. Chalmers.
The <i>Witness</i> is as little Voluntary now as it ever was. It
seems but fair, however, that a principle should be saddled
with only the consequences that legitimately arise from it;
and that Voluntaryism should not be exposed, in this contest,
to a species of witchcraft, that first caricatures it in
an ill-modelled image, and then sticks the ugly thing over
with pins.</p>
<p>The revenues of the State-endowed schools of this
country&ndash;&ndash;and, we suppose, of every other&ndash;&ndash;are derived
from two distinct sources: from Government, who furnishes
the schoolmaster&#8217;s salary, and erects the building in
which he teaches; and from the parents or guardians, who
remunerate him according to certain graduated rates for
the kind of instruction which he communicates to their
children or wards. And the <i>rationale</i> of this State assistance
seems very obvious. It is of importance to the State,
both on economic and judicial grounds, that all its people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
should be taught; but, on the adventure-school principle,
it is impossible that they should all be taught, seeing that
adventure schools can thrive in only densely peopled
localities, or where supported by wealthy families, that pay
largely for their children&#8217;s education. And so, in order
that education may be brought down to the humblest of
the people, the State supplements, in its own and its
people&#8217;s behalf, the schoolmaster&#8217;s income, and builds him
a school. Such seems to be the principle of educational
endowments. Now, if the State, in endowing national
schoolmasters, were to signify that it endowed them in
order that, among other things, they should <i>teach religion</i>, we
can well see how a Voluntary who conscientiously holds, as
such, that religion ought not to be State-endowed, might be
unable to avail himself, on his children&#8217;s behalf, of the State-enjoined
religious teaching of any such functionaries; just
as we can also see, that if the State <i>forbade</i> its schoolmasters
on any account to teach religion, a conscientious holder of
the Establishment principle might be perhaps equally unable
to avail himself of services so restricted. We can at
least see how each, in turn, might lodge an alternate protest,&ndash;&ndash;the
one against the positive exclusion of religion by
the State, the other against its positive introduction. But
if, according to Chalmers, the State, aware of the difficulty,
tenders its endowment and builds its schools &#8216;simply as an
expression of its value for a good secular education,&#8217; and
avowedly leaves the religious part of the school training to
be determined by the parties who furnish that moiety of the
schoolmaster&#8217;s support derived from fees&ndash;&ndash;<i>i.e.</i> the parents
or guardians&ndash;&ndash;we find in the arrangement ground on which
the Voluntary and the Establishment man can meet and
agree. For the State virtually wills by such a settlement&ndash;&ndash;and
both by what it demands, and by what it does <i>not</i>
demand, but <i>permits</i>&ndash;&ndash;that its salaried functionary should
stand to his employers, the people, simply in the relation of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
an adventure schoolmaster. The State says virtually to its
teacher in such circumstances: &#8216;I, as the <i>general</i> guardian
of your pupils, do not pay you for their religious education;
but their <i>particular</i> and special guardians, the parents, are
quite at liberty to make with you on that head whatever
bargain they please. Fully aware of the vast importance of
religious teaching, and yet wholly unable, from the denominational
differences of the time, at once to provide for it in
the national seminaries, and to render these equal to the
wants of the country, I throw the whole responsibility in
this matter on the divided people, whom I cannot unite in
their religion, but whose general education I am not on
that account at liberty to neglect.&#8217; On grounds such as
these, we repeat, Voluntaryism and the Establishment principle
may meet and agree.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt, however, that there are men
on both sides sparingly gifted with common sense: for
never yet was there a great question widely and popularly
agitated, that did not divide not only the wise men, but
also the fools of the community; and we have heard it
urged by some of the representatives of the weaker class,
that a Voluntary could not permit his children to be taught
religion under a roof provided by the State. Really, with
all respect for the cap and bells, this is driving the matter a
little too far. We have been told by a relative, now deceased,
who served on shipboard during the first revolutionary
war, and saw some hard fighting, that at the close of a
hot engagement, in which victory remained with the British,
the captain of the vessel in which he sailed&ndash;&ndash;a devout and
brave man&ndash;&ndash;called his crew together upon the quarter-deck,
and offered up thanks to God in an impressive
prayer. The noble ship in which he sailed was the property
of the State, and he himself a State-paid official; but
was there anything in either circumstance to justify a protest
from even the most rabid Voluntary against the part
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
which he acted on this interesting occasion, simply as a
Christian hero? Nay, had he sought to employ and pay
out of his private purse in behalf of his crew an evangelical
missionary, as decidedly Voluntary in his views as John
Foster or Robert Hall, would the man have once thought
of objecting to the work because it was to be prosecuted
under the shelter of beams and planks, every one of which
belonged to the Government? Would a pious Voluntary
soldier keep aloof from a prayer-meeting on no other
ground than that it was held in a barrack?&ndash;&ndash;or did the first
Voluntaries of Great Britain, the high-toned Independents
that fought under Cromwell, abstain from their preachings
and their prayers when cooped up by the enemy in a
garrison? Where is the religious Voluntary who would not
exhort in a prison, or offer up an unbought prayer on a
public, State-provided scaffold, for some wretched criminal
shivering on the verge of the grave?</p>
<p>Now the schoolmaster, in the circumstances laid down
by Chalmers, we hold to be in at least as favourable a
position with respect to the State and the State-erected
edifice in which he teaches, as the ship-captain or the non-commissioned
missionary&ndash;&ndash;the devout Voluntary soldier,
or the pious Independents of Cromwell&#8217;s Ironsides. He is,
in his secular character, a State-paid official, sheltered by an
erection the property of the State; but the State permits
him to bear in that erection another character, in relation
to another certain employer, whom it recognises as quite as
legitimately in the field as itself, and permits him also&ndash;&ndash;though
it does not enjoin&ndash;&ndash;to perform his duties there as a
Christian man. Though, however, the objection to religious
teaching under the State-erected roof may be suffered to
drop, there may be an objection raised&ndash;&ndash;and there has
been an objection raised&ndash;&ndash;against the teaching of religion
in certain periods of time during the day, for which it is
somehow taken for granted the State pays. Hence the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
argument for teaching religion in certain other periods of
time not paid for by the State&ndash;&ndash;or in other words, during
separate hours. Now the entire difference here seems to
originate in a vicious begging of the question. It is not
the State that specifies the hours during each day in which
State-endowed and State-erected schools are taught; on the
contrary, varying as these hours do, and must, in various
parts of the town and country&ndash;&ndash;for a thinly-peopled district
demands one set of hours, and a densely-peopled locality
another&ndash;&ndash;they are fixed, as mere matters of mutual arrangement,
to suit the convenience of the teachers and the taught.
It is enough that the State satisfy itself, through its inspectors,
that the secular instruction for which it pays is effectually
imparted to its people: it neither does nor will lay
claim to any one hour of the day as its own, whether before
noon or after it. It will leave to the English Establishment
its canonical hours, sacred to organ music and the Liturgy;
but it will set apart by enactment no pedagogical hours,
sacred to arithmetic or algebra, the construing of verbs, or
the drawing of figures. If separate hours merely mean that
the master is not to have all his classes up at once&ndash;&ndash;here
gabbling Latin or Greek, there discussing the primer or
reciting from Scott&#8217;s Collection, yonder repeating the multiplication
table or running over the rules of Lindley Murray&ndash;&ndash;we
at once say religion must have its separate hour, just
as English, the dead tongues, figuring, writing, and the
mathematics, have their separate hours; but if it be meant
that the religious teaching of the school must be restricted
to some hour not paid for by the State, then we reply with
equal readiness that we know of no hour specially paid for
by the State, and so utterly fail to recognise any principle
in the proposed arrangement, or rather in the objection
that would suggest it.</p>
<p>As to the question of a separate fee for religious tuition,
let us consider how it is usually solved in the adventure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
schools of the country. The day is, in most cases, opened
by the master with prayer, and then there is a portion of
Scripture read by the pupils. And neither the Scripture
read nor the prayer offered up fall, we are disposed to
think, under the head of religious tuition, but under a
greatly better head&ndash;&ndash;that of religion itself. It is a proper
devotional beginning of the business of the day. The committal
of the Shorter Catechism&ndash;&ndash;which with most children
is altogether an exercise of memory, but which, accomplished
in youth, while the intellect yet sleeps, produces
effects in after years almost always beneficial to the understanding,
and not unfrequently ameliorative of the heart&ndash;&ndash;we
place in a different category. It is not religion, but the
teaching of religion; not food for the present, but store
laid up for the future. With the committal to memory of
the Catechism we class that species of Scripture dissection
now so common in schools, which so often mangles what
it carves.<a name='FNanchor_0013' id='FNanchor_0013'></a><a href='#Footnote_0013' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> And religion taught in this way is and ought to
be represented in the fee paid to the teacher, and is and
ought to be taught in a class as separate from all the others
as the geography or the grammar class. Such is, we understand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
a common arrangement in Scottish adventure schools;
nor does there exist a single good reason for preventing it
from also obtaining in the Scottish national schools. If the
parentage of Scotland, whether Voluntary or Establishment,
were to be vested with the power of determining that it
should be so, and of selecting their schoolmasters, the
schools would open with prayer and the reading of the
Word&ndash;&ndash;not because they were State-endowed, but because,
the State leaving the point entirely open, they were the schools
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
of a Christian land, to which Christian parents had sent their
children, and for which, on their own proper responsibility,
they had chosen, so far as they could determine the point,
Christian teachers. And for this religious part of the services
of the day we would deem it derogatory to the character
of a schoolmaster to suppose that he <i>could</i> receive any
remuneration from the parents of his pupils, or from any one
else. For the proper devotional services of the school we
would place on exactly the same high disinterested level as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
devotional exercises of the family, or as those of the gallant
officer and his crew, who, paid for but the defence of their
country, gave God thanks on the blood-stained quarter-deck,
in their character as Christians, that He had sheltered their
heads in one of their country&#8217;s battles, and then cast themselves
in faith upon His further care. We would, we say,
deem it an insult to the profession to speak of a monetary
remuneration for the read word or the prayer offered up.
Nay, if either was rated at but a single penny as its price,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
or if there was a single penny expected for either, where is
there the man, Voluntary or Free Church, that would deem
it worth the money? The story of the footman, who, upon
being told, on entering on his new place, that he would
have to attend family prayers, expressed a hope that the
duty would be considered in his wages, has become one of
the standard jokes of our jest-books. We would, however,
place the religious teaching of the school on an entirely
different footing from its religious services. We would
assign to <i>it</i> its separate class and its separate time, just as
we would assign a separate class and time to the teaching
of English grammar, or history, or the dead languages.
And whether the remuneration was specified or merely
understood, we would deem it but reasonable that this
branch of teaching, like all the other branches which occupied
the time and tasked the exertions of the teacher, should
be remunerated by a fee: in this department of tuition, as in
the others, we would deem the labourer worthy of his hire.
We need scarce add, however, that we would recognise no
power in the majority of any locality, or in the schoolmaster
whom they had chosen, to render attendance at even
the devotional services of the seminary compulsory on the
children of parents who, on religious or other grounds, willed
that they should not join in the general worship. And, of
course, attendance on the religion-teaching class would be
altogether as much a matter of arrangement between the
parent and the schoolmaster, as attendance on the Latin or
English classes, or on arithmetic, algebra, or the mathematics.</p>
<p>While, however, we can see no proper grounds for difference
between Voluntaries and Free Churchmen, on even
these details of school management, and see, further, that
they never differ regarding the way in which the adventure
schools of the country are conducted, we must remind the
reader that all on which they have really to agree on this
question, as Scotchmen and franchise-holders, is simply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
whether their country ought not, in the first place, to possess
an efficient system of national schools, open to all
the Christian denominations; whether, in the second, the
parents ought not to be permitted to exercise, on their
own responsibility, the natural right of determining what
their children should be taught; and whether, in the third,
the householders of a district ought not to be vested in the
power, now possessed by the heritors and parish minister,
of choosing the teacher. Agreement on these heads is
really all that is necessary towards either the preliminary
agitation of the question, or in order to secure its ultimate
success. The minor points would all come to be settled,
not on the legislative platform, but in the parishes, by the
householders. Voluntaryism, wise and foolish, does not
reckon up more than a third of the population of Scotland;
and foolish, <i>i.e.</i> extreme Voluntaries&ndash;&ndash;for the sensible ones
would be all with us&ndash;&ndash;would find themselves, when they
came to record their votes, a very small minority indeed.
And so, though their extreme views may now be represented
as lions in the path, it would be found ultimately
that, like the lions which affrighted Pilgrim in the avenue,
and made the poor man run back, they are lions well
chained up&ndash;&ndash;<i>lions</i>, in short, in a <i>minority</i>, like the agricultural
lion in <i>Punch</i>. Let us remark, further, that if
some of our friends deem the scheme proposed for Scotland
too little religious, it is as certain that the assertors
of the scheme now proposed for England, and advocated
in Parliament by Mr. Fox, very decidedly object to it on
the opposite score. Like the grace said by the Rev.
Reuben Butler, which was censured by the Captain of
Knockdunder as too long, and by douce Davie Deans as
too short, it is condemned for faults so decidedly antagonistic
in their character, that they cannot co-exist together.
One class of persons look exclusively at that lack of a
statutory recognition of religion which the scheme involves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
and denounce it as <i>infidel</i>; another, at the religious character
of the people of Scotland, and at the consequent certainty,
also involved in the scheme, that they will render
their schools transcripts of themselves, and so they condemn
it as <i>orthodox</i>. And hence the opposite views entertained
by Mr. Combe of Edinburgh on the one hand, and Mr.
Gibson of Glasgow on the other.<a name='FNanchor_m097_1' id='FNanchor_m097_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_m097_1' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a></p>

<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER SEVENTH.</h3>
<p class="ch_summary" >General Outline of an Educational Scheme adequate to the demands of the Age&ndash;&ndash;Remuneration
of Teachers&ndash;&ndash;Mode of their Election&ndash;&ndash;Responsibility&ndash;&ndash;Influence
of the Church in such a Scheme&ndash;&ndash;Apparent Errors of the Church&ndash;&ndash;The Circumstances
of Scotland very different now from what they were in the days of Knox.</p>
<p>Scotland will never have an efficient educational system
at once worthy of her ancient fame, and adequate to the
demands of the age, until in every parish there be at least
one central school, known emphatically as the <i>Parish</i> or
Grammar School, and taught by a superior university-bred
teacher, qualified to instruct his pupils in the higher departments
of learning, and fit them for college. And with this
central institute every parish must also possess its supplementary
English schools, efficient of their kind, though of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
a lower standing, and sufficiently numerous to receive all
the youthful population of the district which fails to be
accommodated in the other. In these, the child of the
labourer or mechanic&ndash;&ndash;if, possessed of but ordinary powers,
he looked no higher than the profession of his father&ndash;&ndash;could
be taught to read, write, and figure. If, however,
there awakened within him during the process, the stirrings
of those impulses which characterize the superior mind, he
could remove to his proper place&ndash;&ndash;the central school&ndash;&ndash;mayhap,
in country districts, some two or three miles away;
but when the intellectual impulses are genuine, two or three
miles in such cases are easily got over.</p>
<p>We would fix for the teachers, in the first instance, on
no very extravagant rate of remuneration; for it might
prove bad policy in this, as in other departments, to set a
man above his work. The salaries attached at present to
our parish schools vary from a minimum of &pound;25 to a
maximum of about &pound;34. Let us suppose that they varied,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
instead, from a minimum of &pound;60 to a maximum of &pound;80&ndash;&ndash;not
large sums, certainly, but which, with the fees and a
free house, would render every parochial schoolmaster in
Scotland worth about from &pound;80 to &pound;100 per annum, and
in some cases&ndash;&ndash;dependent, of course, on professional efficiency
and the population of the locality&ndash;&ndash;worth considerably
more. The supplementary English schools we would
place on the average level maintained at present by our
parish schools, by providing the teachers with free houses,
and yearly salaries of a minimum of &pound;30 and a maximum
of &pound;40. And as it is of great importance that men should
not fall asleep at their posts, and as tutors never teach
more efficiently than when straining to keep ahead of their
pupils, we would fain have provision made that, by a permitted
use of occasional substitutes, this lower order of
schoolmasters should be enabled to prepare themselves, by
attendance at college, for competing, as vacancies occurred,
for the higher schools. It would be an arrangement worth
&pound;20 additional salary to every school in Scotland, that the
channels of preferment should be ever kept open to useful
talent and honest diligence, so that the humblest English
teacher in the land might rise, in the course of years, to be
at the head of its highest school; nay, that, like that James
Beattie who taught at one time the parish school of Fordoun,
he might, if native faculty had been given and wisely
improved, become one of the country&#8217;s most distinguished
professors. In fixing our permanent castes of schools,
Grammar and English, we would strongly urge that there
should be no permanent castes of teachers fixed&ndash;&ndash;no men
condemned to the humbler walks of the profession if qualified
for the higher. The life-giving sap would thus have
free course, from the earth&#8217;s level to the topmost boughs
of our national scheme; and low as an Englishman might
deem our proposed rates of remuneration for university-taught
men, we have no fear that they would prove insufficient,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
coupled with such a provision, for the right education
of the country.</p>
<p>We are not sure that we quite comprehend the sort of
machinery meant to be included under the term Local or
Parochial Boards. It seems necessary that there should
exist Local <i>Committees</i> of the educational franchise-holders,
chosen by themselves, from among their own number, for
terms either definite or indefinite, and recognised by statute
as vested in certain powers of examination and inquiry.
But though a mere name be but a small matter, we are inclined
to regard the term Board as somewhat too formidable
and stiff. Let us, at least for the present, substitute the
term Committee; and as large committees are apt to degenerate
into little mobs, and, as such, to conduct their
business noisily and ill, let us suppose educational committees
to consist, in at least country districts or the smaller
towns, of some eight or ten individuals, selected by the
householders for their intelligence, integrity, and business
habits, and with a chairman at their head, chosen from
among their number by themselves. A vacancy occurs, let
us suppose, in either the Grammar or one of the English
schools of the place: the committee, through their <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'chair man' over line">chairman</ins>,
put themselves in communication with some of the
Normal schoolmasters of the south, and receive from them
a few names of deserving and qualified teachers, possessed
of diplomas indicating their professional standing, and furnished,
besides, with trustworthy certificates of character.
Or, if the emoluments of the vacant school be considerable,
and some of the neighbouring teachers, placed on a lower
rate of income, have distinguished themselves by their
professional merits, and so rendered themselves known in
the district, let us suppose that they select <i>their</i> names, and
to the number of some two, three, four, or more, submit
them, with the necessary credentials, to their constituents
the householders. And these assemble on some fixed day,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
and, from the number placed on the list, select their men.
Such, in the business of electing a schoolmaster, would, we
hold, be the proper work of a committee. In all other
seasons, the committee might be recognised as vested in
some of the functions now exercised by the Established
presbyteries, such as that of presiding, in behalf of the
parentage of the locality, at yearly or half-yearly examinations
of the schools, and of watching over the general
morals and official conduct of the teacher. But the power
of trial and dismission, which, of course, would need to
exist somewhere, we would vest in other hands. Let us remark,
in the passing, that much might come to depend ultimately
on the portioning out of the localities into electoral
districts of a proper size, and that it would be perhaps well,
as a general rule, that there should be no subdivisions made
of the old parishes. There are few parishes in Scotland in
which the materials of a good committee might not be
found; but there are perhaps many half, and third, and
quarter parishes in which no such materials exist. Further,
the householders of some country hamlet or degraded town-suburb,
populous enough to require its school, might be yet
very unfit of themselves to choose for it a schoolmaster.
And hence the necessity for maintaining a local breadth of
representation sufficient to do justice to the principle of the
scheme, and to prevent it, if we may so speak, from sinking
in the less solid parts of the kingdom. A parochial breadth
of base would serve as if to plank over the unsounder portions
of the general surface, and give footing to a system of
schools and teachers worthy, as a whole, of the character
and the necessities of a country wise and enlightened in
the main, but that totters on the brink of a bottomless
abyss.</p>
<p>The power of trying, and, if necessary, of dismissing from
his charge, an offending teacher, would, however, as we
have said, require to exist somewhere. Every official,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
whether of the State or Church, or whether dependent on a
single employer or on a corporation or company, bears
always a twofold character. He is a subject of the realm,
and, as such, amenable to its laws; he has also an official
responsibility, and may be reprimanded or dismissed for
offences against the requirements and duties of his office.
A tradesman or mechanic may go on tippling for years,
wasting his means and neglecting his business, untouched
by any law save that great economic law of Providence
which dooms the waster to ultimate want; but for the excise
officer, or bank accountant, or railway clerk, who pursues a
similar course, there exists a court of official responsibility,
which anticipates the slow operation of the natural law, by
at once divesting the offender of his office. And the State-paid
schoolmaster must have also his official responsibility.
But it would serve neither the ends of justice nor the interests
of a sound policy to erect his immediate employers into a
court competent to try and condemn: their proper place
would be rather that of parties than of judges; and as
parties, we would permit them simply to conduct against
him any case for which they might hold there existed proper
grounds. A schoolmaster chosen by a not large majority,
might find in a few years that his supporters had dwindled
into a positive minority: parents whose boys were careless,
or naturally thick-headed, would of course arrive at the
opinion that it was the teacher who was in fault; nay, a
parent who had fallen into arrears with his fees might come
to entertain the design of discharging the account simply
by discharging the schoolmaster; and thus great injustice
might be done to worthy and efficient men, and one of the
most important classes of the community placed in circumstances
of a shackled dependency, which no right-minded
teacher could submit to occupy. What we would propose,
then, is, that the power of trial, and of dismission if necessary,
should be vested in a central national board, furnished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
with one or more salaried functionaries to record its sentences
and do its drudgery, but consisting mainly of unpaid
members of high character and standing,&ndash;&ndash;some of them,
mayhap, members <i>ex officio</i>; the Lord Provost of Edinburgh,
let us suppose&ndash;&ndash;the Principal and some of the Professors of
the Edinburgh University&ndash;&ndash;the Rector, shall we say, of the
High School&ndash;&ndash;the Lord Advocate, and mayhap the Dean
of Faculty. And as it would be of importance that there
should be as little new machinery created as possible, the
evidence, criminatory or exculpatory, on which such a board
would have to decide could be taken before the Sheriff
Courts of the provinces, and then, after being carefully sifted
by the Sheriffs or their Substitutes, forwarded in a documentary
form to Edinburgh. It would scarce be wise to
attempt extemporizing an official code in a newspaper
article; but the laws of such a code might, we think, be
ranged under three heads,&ndash;&ndash;immorality, incompetency, and
breach of trust to the parents. We would urge the dismissal,
as wholly unqualified to stand in the relation of teacher
to the youthhead, of the tippling, licentious, or dishonest
schoolmaster; further, we would urge the dismissal (and in
cases of this kind the corroborative evidence of the Government
inspector might be regarded as indispensable) of an
incompetent teacher who did not serve the purpose of his
appointment; and, in the third and last place, we would
urge that a teacher who made an improper use of his professional
influence over his pupils, and of the opportunities
necessarily afforded him, and who taught them to entertain
beliefs, ecclesiastical or semi-ecclesiastical, which their
parents regarded as erroneous, should be severely reprimanded
for such an offence in the first instance, and dismissed
if he persevered in it. We would confer upon the
board, in cases of this last kind, no power of deciding regarding
the absolute right or wrong of the dogmas taught.
The teacher might be a zealous Voluntary, who assured the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
children of men such as the writer of these articles that
their fathers, in asserting the Establishment principle, approved
themselves limbs of that mystic Babylon which was
first founded by Constantine; or he might be a conscientious
Establishment-man, who dutifully pressed upon the Voluntary
pupils under his care, that their parents, though they perhaps
did not know it, were atheistical in their views. And we
would permit no board to determine in such cases, whether
Voluntaryism was in any respect or degree tantamount to
atheism, or the Establishment principle to Popery. But
we would ask them to declare, as wise and honest men, that
no schoolmaster, under the pretext of a zeal for truth, should
with impunity break faith with the parents of his pupils, or
prejudice the unformed and ductile minds entrusted to his
care against their hereditary beliefs. Should we, however,
do no violence by such a provision, we have heard it asked,
to the conscientious convictions of the schoolmaster? No,
not in the least. If he was in reality the conscientious man
that he professed to be, he would quit his equivocal position
as a teacher, in which, without being dishonest, he could
not fulfil what he deemed his religious duty, and become a
minister; a character in which he would find Churches
within which he could affirm with impunity that Dr. Chalmers
was, in virtue of his Establishment views, little better than
a Papist, or that Robert Hall, seeing he was a Voluntary,
must have been an unconscious atheist at bottom.</p>
<p>Let us next consider what the influence of the ministers
of our Church would be under a national scheme such as
that which we desiderate, and what the probability that the
national teaching would be religious. The minister, as
such, would possess, nominally at least, but a single vote;
and if he were what an ordained minister may in some
cases be&ndash;&ndash;merely a suit of black clothes surmounted by a
white neckcloth&ndash;&ndash;the vote, <i>nominally</i> one, would be also
<i>really</i> but one; nor ought it, we at once say, to weigh in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
such cases an iota more than it counted. Mere black coats
and white neckcloths, though called by congregations, and
licensed and ordained by presbyteries, never yet carried on
the proper business of either Church or school. But if the
minister was no mere suit of clothes, but a Christian man,
ordained and called not merely by congregations and presbyteries,
but by God Himself, his one vote in the case would
outweigh hundreds, simply because it would represent the
votes of hundreds. Let us suppose that, with the national
schools thrown open, a vacancy had occurred in the parish
school of Cromarty during the incumbency of the lamented
Mr. Stewart. The people of the town and parish, possessing
the educational franchise, would meet; their committee
would deliberate; there would be a teacher chosen,&ndash;&ndash;in all
probability, the present excellent Free Church teacher of
the town; and every man would feel that he had exercised
in the election his own judgment on his own proper responsibility.
And yet it would assuredly be the teacher
whom the minister had deemed on the whole most eligible
for the office, that would find himself settled, in virtue of
the transaction, in the parish school. How? Not, certainly,
through any exercise of clerical domination, nor
through any employment of what is still more hateful&ndash;&ndash;clerical
man&oelig;uvre&ndash;&ndash;but in virtue of a widespread confidence
reposed by the people in the wisdom and the integrity
of the minister sent them by God Himself to preach to
them the everlasting gospel. In almost all the surrounding
parishes&ndash;&ndash;in Resolis, Rosskeen, Urquhart under the
late Dr. M&#8217;Donald, Alness, Kiltearn, Kincardine, Kilmuir,
etc. etc. etc.&ndash;&ndash;in similar cases similar results would follow;
and if there are preachers in that vast northern or north-western
tract&ndash;&ndash;which, with the three northern counties,
includes also almost the entire Highlands&ndash;&ndash;in which such
results would <i>not</i> follow, it would be found that in most
cases the fault lay rather with the ordained suits of black,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
topped by the white neckcloths, than with the people whom
they failed to influence.</p>
<p>As for the religion or the religious teaching of the schools,
we hold it to be one of the advantages of the proposed
scheme, that it would really stir up both ministers and
people to think seriously of the matter, and to secure for
the country truly religious teaching, so far as it was found
to be at once practicable and good. Previous to the year
1843, when the parish schools lay fully within our power,
there was really nothing done to introduce religious teaching
into <i>them</i>; we had it all secure on written sheepskin,
that their teaching should and might be religious, for we
had them all fast bound to the Establishment; and, as if
that were enough of itself, ministers, backed by heritors and
their factors, went on filling these parish schools with men
who stood the test of the Disruption worse, in the proportion
of at least five to one, than any other class in the
country, and who, if their religious teaching had but taken
effect on the people by bringing them to their own level,
would have rendered that Disruption wholly an impossibility.<a name='FNanchor_0014' id='FNanchor_0014'></a><a href='#Footnote_0014' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a>
And then, when that great event occurred, we
flung ourselves into an opposite extreme,&ndash;&ndash;eulogized our
Educational Scheme as the best and most important of all
the Schemes of our Church, on, we suppose, the principle
so well understood by the old divines, that whereas the
other schemes were of God, and God-enjoined, this scheme
was of ourselves,&ndash;&ndash;introduced, further, the design of &#8216;<i>inducting</i>&#8217;
our teachers, as if an idle ceremony could be any
substitute for the indispensable commission signed by the
Sovereign, and could make the non-commissioned by Him
at least <i>half</i> ecclesiastics.<a name='FNanchor_0015' id='FNanchor_0015'></a><a href='#Footnote_0015' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a> And then, after <i>teaching</i> our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
schoolmasters to <i>teach</i> religion, we sent them abroad in
shoals&ndash;&ndash;some of them, no doubt, converted men, hundreds
of them unconverted, and religious but by certificate&ndash;&ndash;to
make the children of the Free Church as good Christians
as themselves. And by attempting to make them half
ecclesiastics, we have but succeeded in making them half
mendicants, and somewhat more,&ndash;&ndash;a character which assuredly
no efficient schoolmaster ought to bear; for while
his profession holds in Scripture no higher place than the
two <i>secular</i> branches of the learned professions, physic
and the law, he is as certainly worthy of his reward, and of
maintaining an independent position in society, as either
the lawyer or the physician. In schools truly national&ndash;&ndash;with
no sheepskin authority to sleep over on the one hand,
and no idle dream of semi-ecclesiastical &#8216;induction&#8217; to
beguile on the other&ndash;&ndash;the item of religious teaching,
brought into prominence by both the Free and the Established
Churches in the preliminary struggle, would assert
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
and receive its due place. Scotland would possess what
it never yet possessed,&ndash;&ndash;not even some twenty years or so
after the death of Knox,&ndash;&ndash;a system of schools worthy, in the
main, of a Christian country. We are told by old Robert
Blair, in his Autobiography, that when first brought under
religious impressions (in the year 1600), &#8216;he durst never
play on the Lord&#8217;s day, though the schoolmaster, after
taking an account of the Catechism, dismissed the children
with that express direction, &#8220;Go not to the town, but to
the fields, and play.&#8221; I obeyed him,&#8217; adds the worthy
man, &#8216;in going to the fields, but refused to play with my
companions, as against the commandment of God.&#8217; Now
it is not at all strange that there should have been such a
schoolmaster, in any age of the Presbyterian Church, in
one of the parish schools of our country; but somewhat
strange, mayhap, considering the impression so generally
received regarding the Scottish schools of that period, that
Blair should have given us no reason whatever to regard
the case as an extreme or exceptional one. Certainly,
with such a central board in existence as that which we
desiderate, no such type of schoolmaster would continue to
hold office in a national seminary.</p>
<p>Further, it really seems difficult to determine whether
the difference between the old educational scheme of Knox
and that proposed at the present time by the Free Church,
or the difference between the circumstances of Scotland in
his days and of Scotland in the present day, be in truth the
wider difference of the two. Knox judged it of &#8216;necessitie
that every several kirk should have one schoolmaster appointed,&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;such
a one at least as was able to teach grammar
and the Latine tongue;&#8217; &#8216;that there should be erected
in every notable town,&#8217; a &#8216;colledge, in which the arts,
logic, and rhethorick, together with the tongues, should
be read by masters, for whom <i>honest</i> stipends should be
appointed;&#8217; and further, &#8216;that fair provision should be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
made for the [support of the] poor [pupils], in especial
those who came from landward,&#8217; and were &#8216;not able, by
their friends nor by themselves, to be sustained at letters.&#8217;
We know that the notable towns referred to here as of
importance enough to possess colleges were, many of them,
what we would now deem far from notable. Kirkwall, the
Chanonry of Ross, Brechin, St. Andrews, Inverary, Jedburgh,
and Dumfries, are specially named in the list; and
we know further, that what Knox deemed an &#8216;honest
stipend&#8217; for a schoolmaster, amounted on the average to
about two-thirds the stipend of a minister. Such, in the
sixteenth century, was the wise scheme of the liberal and
scholarly Knox, the friend of Calvin, Beza, and Buchanan.
Are we to recognise its counterpart in the middle of the
nineteenth century, in a scheme at least three-fourths of
whose teachers are paid with yearly salaries of from &pound;10
to &pound;13, 13s. 4d.&ndash;&ndash;about half ploughman&#8217;s wages&ndash;&ndash;and of
whom not a fourth have passed the ordeal of a Government
examination, pitched at the scale of the lowest rate
of attainment? The scheme of the noble Knox! Say
rather a many-ringed film-spinning grub, that has come
creeping out of the old crackling parchment, in which the
sagacious Reformer approved himself as much in advance
of his own age, as many of those who profess to walk most
closely in his steps demonstrate themselves to be in the
rear of theirs.</p>
<p>Let us next mark how entirely the circumstances of the
country have changed since the days of the First Book of
Discipline. With the exception of the clergy, a few lay
proprietors, and a sprinkling of the inhabitants of the
larger towns, Scotland was altogether, in the earlier period,
an uneducated nation. Even for more than a century after,
there were landed gentlemen of the northern counties unable,
as shown by old deeds, to sign their names. If the
Church had not taken upon herself the education of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
people in those ages, who else was there to teach them?
Not one. Save for her exertions, the divine command,
&#8216;Search the Scriptures,&#8217; would have remained to at least
nine-tenths of the nation a dead letter. But how entirely
different the circumstances of Scotland in the present time!
The country has its lapsed masses,&ndash;&ndash;men in very much the
circumstances, educationally, of the great bulk of the population
in the age of Knox; and we at once grant that,
unless the Churches of the country deal with these as
Knox dealt with the whole, there is but little chance of
their ever being restored to society or the humanizing
influences of religion, let Government make for them what
provision it may.<a name='FNanchor_0016' id='FNanchor_0016'></a><a href='#Footnote_0016' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a> But such is not the condition of the
membership of at least the evangelical Churches. Such is
palpably not the condition of the membership of the Free
Church, consisting as it does of parents taken solemnly
bound, in their baptismal engagements, to bring up their
children in the &#8216;nurture and admonition of the Lord,&#8217; and
of the children for whom they have been thus taken
bound. Save in a few exceptional cases, <i>their</i> education
is secure, let the Church exert herself as little as she
may. She is but exhausting herself in vain efforts to do
what would be done better without her. She has all along
contemplated, we are told, merely the education of her
own members; and these form exactly that portion of the
people which&ndash;&ndash;unless, indeed, the solemn engagements
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
which she has deliberately laid upon them mean as little as
excise affidavits or Bow Street oaths&ndash;&ndash;may be safely left
to a broad national scheme, wisely based on a principle of
parental responsibility.</p>
<p>&#8216;If thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time,&#8217; said
Mordecai to Esther, &#8216;then shall there enlargement and
deliverance arise to the Jews from another place, but thou
and thy father&#8217;s house shall be destroyed.&#8217; Scotland will
have ultimately her Educational Scheme adequate to the
demands of the age; but if the Free Church stand aloof,
and suffer the battle to be fought by others, her part or lot
in it may be a very small matter indeed. What, we ask,
would be her share, especially in the Highlands, in a scheme
that rendered the basis of the educational franchise merely
co-extensive with the basis of the political one? Nay,
what, save perhaps in the northern burghs, would be her
share in such a scheme over Scotland generally? A mere
makeweight at best. But at least the lay membership of
the Free Church will, we are assured, not long stand aloof;
and this great question of national education being in no
degree an ecclesiastical one, nor lying within the jurisdiction
of presbyteries or assemblies, true lovers of their
country and of their species, whether of the Established or
of the Free Churches, will come forward and do their duty
as Scotchmen on the political platform. In neither body
does the attitude assumed by the ecclesiastical element in
this question, so far as has yet been indicated, appear of a
kind which plain, simple-minded laymen will delight to contemplate.
The Established Church courts are taking up
the ground that the teaching in their parish schools has
been all along religious, and at least one great source from
which has sprung the vitalities of the country&#8217;s faith. And
who does not know that to be a poor, unsolid fiction,&ndash;&ndash;a
weak and hollow sham? And, on the other hand, some of
our Free Churchmen are asserting that they are not <i>morally</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
bound to their forlorn teachers for the meagre and altogether
inadequate salaries held out to them in prospect,
when they were set down in their humble schools, divorced
from all other means of support, to regulate their very
limited expenditure by the specified incomes. Further,
they virtually tell us that we cannot possibly take our stand
as Scotchmen on this matter, in the only practical position,
without being untrue to our common Christianity, and
enemies to our Church. It has been urged against our
educational articles, that we have failed to take into account
the fall of man: he would surely be an incorrigible
sceptic, we reply, who could look upon statements such as
these, and yet doggedly persist in doubting that man has
fallen. But, alas! it is not a matter on which to congratulate
ourselves, that when the Established Church is coming
forward to arrest the progress of national education with
her strange equivocal caveat, the Free Church&ndash;&ndash;the Church
of the Disruption&ndash;&ndash;should be also coming forward with a
caveat which at least <i>seems</i> scarce less equivocal; and that,
like the twin giants of Guildhall&ndash;&ndash;huge, monstrous, unreal&ndash;&ndash;both
alike should be turning deaf and wooden ears to
the great clock of destiny, as it strikes the hours of doom
to their distracted and sinking country. O for an hour
of the great, the noble-minded Chalmers! Ultimately,
however, the good cause is secure. It is a cause worth
struggling and suffering for. We know a little boy, not
yet much of a reader, who has learned to bring a copy of
Scott&#8217;s <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>, which now opens of itself
at the battle of Bannockburn, to a little girl, his sister,
somewhat more in advance, that she may read to him, for
the hundredth time, of Wallace and the Black Douglas,
and how the good King Robert struck down Sir Henry
Bohun with a single blow, full in the sight of both armies.
And after drinking in the narrative, he tells that, when
grown to be a big man, he too is to be a soldier like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
Robert the Bruce, and to &#8216;fight in the battle of Scotland.&#8217;
And then he asks his father when the battle of Scotland
is to begin! Laymen of the Free Church, the battle of
Scotland has already begun; and &#8217;tis a battle better worth
fighting than any other which has arisen within the political
arena since the times of the Reform Bill. Your country
has still claims upon you: the Disruption may have dissolved
the tie which bound you to party; but that which
binds you to Scotland still remains entire. The parental
right is not dissolved by any traditionary requirements of
the altar; nor can we urge with impunity to our country,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;It
is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou
mightest be profited by me.&#8217;</p>

<h2>LORD BROUGHAM.</h2>
</div>
<p>The history of Lord Brougham has no exact parallel in
that of British statesmen. Villiers Duke of Buckingham
(the Duke of the times of Charles II.) sunk quite as low,
but not from such an elevation. Of him too it was said,
as of his Lordship, that &#8216;he left not faction, but of that was
left,&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;that every party learned to distrust and stand aloof
from him, and that his great parts had only the effect of
rendering his ultimate degradation the more marked and
the more instructive. Hume tells us that by his &#8216;wild conduct,
unrestrained either by prudence or principle, he found
means to render himself in the end odious, and even insignificant.&#8217;
But the Duke of Buckingham had been a
mere courtier from the beginning, and no man had ever
trusted or thought well of him.</p>
<p>Bolingbroke bears a nearly similar character. There
was a mighty difference between the influential and able
minister of Queen Anne, recognised by all as decidedly
one of the most accomplished statesmen of his age or
country, and the same individual,&ndash;&ndash;forlorn and an exile,
disliked and suspected by parties the most opposite, and
who agreed in nothing else,&ndash;&ndash;a fugitive from his own
country to avoid the threatened impeachment of the Whigs
for his Jacobitism, and a fugitive from France to avoid
being impeached by the Pretender for his treachery. But
Bolingbroke had never very seriously professed to be the
friend of his country, nor would his country have believed
him if he had. According to the shrewd remark of Fielding,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
the temporal happiness, the civil liberties and properties
of Europe, had been the game of his earliest youth, and
the eternal and final happiness of all mankind the sport
and entertainment of his advanced age. He would have
fain destroyed the freedom of his countrymen when in
power, and their hope of immortality when in disgrace.
Neither can we find a parallel in the history of that other
Lord Chancellor of England, who has been described by
the poet as &#8216;the greatest, wisest, meanest of mankind.&#8217;
Two of the epithets would not suit Lord Brougham; and
though he unquestionably bore himself more honourably in
the season of his elevation than his illustrious predecessor,
he has as certainly employed himself to worse purpose in
the time of his disgrace.</p>
<p>Unlike Lords Bolingbroke, Buckingham, or Bacon, Lord
Brougham entered public life a reformer and a patriot.
The subject of his first successful speech in Parliament was
the slave-trade. He denounced not only the abominable
traffic itself,&ndash;&ndash;the men who stole, bought, and kept the
slave; but also the traders and merchants,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;the cowardly
suborners of piracy and mercenary murder,&#8217; as he termed
them, under whose remote influence the trade had been
carried on; and the sympathies of the people went along
with him. He was on every occasion, too, the powerful
advocate of popular education. Brougham is no discoverer
of great truths; but he has evinced a &#8216;curious felicity&#8217; in
expressing truths already discovered: he exerted himself in
sending &#8216;the schoolmaster abroad,&#8217; and announced the fact
in words which became more truly his motto than the motto
found for him in the Herald&#8217;s Office. He took part in well-nigh
every question of reform; stood up for economy, the
reduction of taxes, and Queen Caroline; found very vigorous
English in which to express all he ought to have felt regarding
the Holy Alliance and the massacre at Manchester;
and dealt with Cobbett as Cobbett deserved, for doing what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
he is now doing himself. There was always a lack of heart
about Brougham, so that men admired without loving him.</p>
<p>There were no spontaneous exhibitions of those noblenesses
of nature which mark the true reformer, and which
compel the respect of even enemies. Luther, Knox, and
Andrew Thomson were all men of rugged strength,&ndash;&ndash;men
of war, and born to contend; but they were also men of
deep and broad sympathies, and of kindly affections: they
could all feel as well as see the right; what is even more
important still, they could all thoroughly forget themselves,
and what the world thought and said of them, in the pursuit
of some great and engrossing object: they could all love,
too, at least as sincerely as they could hate. Brougham, on
the contrary, could only see without feeling the right; but
then he saw clearly. Brougham could not forget himself;
but then he succeeded in identifying himself with much that
was truly excellent. Brougham could not love as thoroughly
as he could hate; but then his indignation generally fell
where it ought. His large intellect seemed based on an
inferior nature&ndash;&ndash;it was a brilliant set in lead; nor were
there indications wanting all along, it has been said, that
he was one of those patriots who have their price. But the
brilliant was a true, not a factitious brilliant, whatever the
value of the setting; and the price, if ever proffered, had not
been sufficiently large. Brougham became Lord Chancellor,
the Reform Bill passed into a law, and slavery was abolished
in the colonies.</p>
<p>The country has not yet forgotten that the Lord Chancellor
of 1832 and the two following years was no wild
Radical. There was no leaven of Chartism in Lord
Brougham, though a very considerable dash of eccentricity;
and really, for a man who had been contending
so many years in the Opposition, and who had attained
to so thorough a command of sarcasm, he learned to enact
the courtier wonderfully well. Neither &#8216;Tompkins&#8217; nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
&#8216;Jenkins&#8217; had as yet manifested their contempt for the
aristocracy; nor had the &#8216;man well stricken in years&#8217;
written anonymous letters to insult his sovereign. The
universal suffrage scheme found no advocate in the Lord
Chancellor. He could call on Cobbett in his chariot, to
attempt persuading the stubborn old Saxon to write down
incendiarism and machine-breaking. He breathed no
anticipation of the &#8216;first cheer of the people on the first
refusal of the soldiery to fire on them.&#8217; As for Reform,
he was very explicit on that head: really so much had
been accomplished already, that a great deal more could
not be expected. Little could be done in the coming
years, he said, just because there had been so much done
in the years that had gone by. The Lord Chancellor was
comparatively a cautious and prudent man in those days&ndash;&ndash;on
the whole, a safe card for monarchy to play with.
Radicalism had learned that Whigs in office are not very
unlike Tories in office; and to Brougham it applied the
remark: nor was he at all indignant that it did so. All
his superabundant energies were expended in Chancery.
We unluckily missed hearing him deliver his famous speech
at Inverness, and that merely by an untoward chance, for
we were in that part of the country at the time; but we
have seen and conversed with scores who did hear him:
we are intimate, too, with the gentleman who gave his
speech on that occasion to the world, and know that a
more faithful or more accomplished reporter than the
editor of the <i>Inverness Courier</i> is not to be found anywhere,
nor yet a man of nicer discrimination, nor of a
finer literary taste. There was no mistake made regarding
his Lordship&#8217;s sentiments when he spoke of the Reform
Bill as well-nigh a final measure; nor did his delight in
the simple-minded natives arise when he pledged himself
to recommend them, by the evening mail, to the graces
of good King William, from their wishing the bill to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
anything else than final. Even with its limited franchise,
he deemed it a very excellent bill; and the woolsack, to
which it had elevated him, a very desirable seat. People
did occasionally see that Hazlitt was in the right&ndash;&ndash;that
he was rather a man of speech than of action; that he
was somewhat too imprudent for a leader, somewhat too
petulant for a partisan; and that he wanted in a considerable
degree the principle of co-operation.</p>
<p>But Chatham wanted it quite as much as he; and it was
deemed invidious to measure so accomplished a man, and
so sworn a friend of peace and good order, by the minuter
rules. But Napoleon should have died at Waterloo,
Brougham at Dunrobin.</p>
<p>What is ex-Chancellor Brougham now? What party
trusts to him? What section of the community does he
represent? Frost had his confiding friends and followers,
and Feargus O&#8217;Connor led a numerous and formidable body.
Even Sir William Courtenay had his disciples. Where are
Brougham&#8217;s disciples? What moral influence does the
advocate of popular education, and the indignant denouncer
of the iniquities of the slave-trade, exert? In
what age or what country was there ever a man so &#8216;left
by faction?&#8217; The Socialism of England and the Voluntaryism
of Edinburgh entrust him with their petitions, and
Chartism stands on tiptoe when he rises in his place to
advocate universal suffrage; but no one confides in him.
Owen does not, nor the Rev. Mr. Marshall of Kirkintilloch,
nor yet the conspirators of Sheffield or Newport.
Toryism scarcely thanks him for fighting its battles;
Whiggism abhors him. There is no one credulous enough
to believe that his aims rise any higher than himself, or
blind enough not to see that even his selfishness is so ill-regulated
as to defeat its own little object. His lack of
the higher sentiments, the more generous feelings, the
nobler aims, neutralizes even his intellect. He publishes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
his speeches, carefully solicitous of his fame, and provokes
comparison in laboured dissertations with the oratory of
Demosthenes and Cicero; he eulogizes the Duke of Wellington,
and demands by inference whether he cannot
praise as classically as even the ancients themselves; but
his heartless though well-modulated eloquence lingers in
first editions, like the effusions of inferior minds; nor is
it of a kind which the &#8216;world will find after many days.&#8217;
Brougham will be less known sixty years hence than the
player Garrick is at present.</p>
<p>Bolingbroke, when thrown out of all public employment-gagged,
disarmed, shut out from the possibility of a
return to office, suspected alike by the Government and
the Opposition, and thoroughly disliked by the people to
boot&ndash;&ndash;could yet solace himself in his uneasy and unhonoured
retirement by exerting himself to write down
the Ministry.</p>
<p>And his <i>Craftsmen</i> sold even more rapidly than the
<i>Spectator</i> itself.</p>
<p>But the writings of Brougham do not sell; he lacks even
the solace of Bolingbroke. We have said that his history
is without parallel in that of Britain. Napoleon on his
rock was a less melancholy object: the imprisoned warrior
had lost none of his original power&ndash;&ndash;he was no moral
suicide; the millions of France were still devotedly attached
to him, and her armies would still have followed
him to battle. It was no total forfeiture of character on
his own part that had rendered him so utterly powerless
either for good or ill.</p>

<h2>THE SCOTT MONUMENT.</h2>
</div>
<p>The foundation-stone of the metropolitan monument in
memory of Sir Walter Scott was laid with masonic honours
on Saturday last. The day was pleasant, and the pageant
imposing. All business seemed suspended for the time;
the shops were shut. The one half of Edinburgh had
poured into the streets, and formed by no means the least
interesting part of the spectacle. Every window and balcony
that overlooked the procession, every house-top
almost, had its crowd of spectators. According to the
poet,</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'>&#8216;Rank behind rank, close wedged, hung bellying o&#8217;er;&#8217;<br /></p>
</div>
<p>while the area below, for many hundred yards on either side
the intended site of the monument, presented a continuous
sea of heads. We marked, among the flags exhibited, the
Royal Standard of Scotland, apparently a piece of venerable
antiquity, for the field of gold had degenerated into a field
of drab, and the figure in the centre showed less of leonine
nobleness than of art in that imperfect state in which men
are fain to content themselves with semblances doubtful
and inexpressive, and less than half the result of chance.
The entire pageant was such a one as Sir Walter himself
could perhaps have improved. He would not have fired so
many guns in the hollow, and the grey old castle so near:
he would have found means, too, to prevent the crowd from
so nearly swallowing up the procession. Perhaps no man
had ever a finer eye for pictorial effect than Sir Walter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
whether art or nature supplied the scene. It has been well
said that he rendered Abbotsford a romance in stone and
lime, and imparted to the king&#8217;s visit to Scotland the interest
and dignity of an epic poem. Still, however, the
pageant was an imposing one, and illustrated happily the
influence of a great and original mind, whose energies had
been employed in enriching the national literature, over an
educated and intellectual people.</p>
<p>It is a bad matter when a country is employed in building
monuments to the memory of men chiefly remarkable
for knocking other men on the head; it is a bad matter,
too, when it builds monuments to the memory of mere
courtiers, of whom not much more can be said than that
when they lived they had places and pensions to bestow,
and that they bestowed them on their friends. We cannot
think so ill, however, of the homage paid to genius.</p>
<p>The Masonic Brethren of the several lodges mustered
in great numbers. It has been stated that more than a
thousand took part in the procession. Coleridge, in his
curious and highly original work, <i>The Friend</i>&ndash;&ndash;a work which,
from its nature, never can become popular, but which,
though it may be forgotten for a time, will infallibly be dug
up and brought into public view in the future as an unique
fossil impression of an extinct order of mind&ndash;&ndash;refers to a
bygone class of mechanics, &#8216;to whom every trade was an
allegory, and had its guardian saint.&#8217; &#8216;But the time has
gone by,&#8217; he states, &#8216;in which the details of every art were
ennobled in the eyes of its professors by being spiritually
improved into symbols and mementoes of all doctrines and
all duties.&#8217; We could hardly think so as we stood watching
the procession, with its curiously fantastic accumulation
of ornament and symbol; it seemed, however, rather the
relic of a former age than the natural growth of the present&ndash;&ndash;a
spectre of the past strangely resuscitated.</p>
<p>The laugh, half in ridicule, half in good nature, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
which the crowd greeted every very gaudily dressed member,
richer in symbol and obsolete finery than his neighbour,
showed that the day had passed in which such things
could produce their originally intended effect. Will the
time ever arrive in which stars and garters will claim as
little respect as broad-skirted doublets of green velvet, surmounted
with three-cornered hats tagged with silver lace?
Much, we suppose, must depend upon the characters of
those who wear them, and the kind of services on which
they will come to be bestowed. An Upper House of mere
diplomatists&ndash;&ndash;skilful only to overreach&ndash;&ndash;imprudent enough
to substitute cunning for wisdom&ndash;&ndash;ignorant enough to deem
the people not merely their inferiors in rank, but in discernment
also&ndash;&ndash;weak enough to believe that laws may be
enacted with no regard to the general good&ndash;&ndash;wrapped up
in themselves, and acquainted with the masses only through
their eavesdroppers and dependants&ndash;&ndash;would bring titles and
orders to a lower level in half an age, than the onward progress
of intellect has brought the quaintnesses of mechanic
symbol and mystery in two full centuries. We but smile at
the one, we would learn to execrate the other. Has the
reader ever seen Quarles&#8217; <i>Emblems</i>, or Flavel&#8217;s <i>Husbandry
and Navigation Spiritualized</i>? Both belong to an extinct
species of literature, of which the mechanic mysteries
described by Coleridge, and exhibited in the procession of
Saturday last, strongly remind us. Both alike proceeded
on a process of mind the reverse of the common. Comparison
generally leads from the moral to the physical, from
the abstract to the visible and the tangible; here, on the
contrary, the tangible and the visible&ndash;&ndash;the emblem and the
symbol&ndash;&ndash;were made to lead to the moral and the abstract.
There are beautiful instances, too, of the same school in
the allegories of Bunyan,&ndash;&ndash;the wonders in the house of the
Interpreter, for instance, and the scenes exhibited in the
cave of the &#8216;man named Contemplation.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>Sir Walter&#8217;s monument will have one great merit, regarded
as a piece of art. It will be entirely an original,&ndash;&ndash;such a
piece of architecture as he himself would have delighted to
describe, and the description of which he, and he only,
could have sublimed into poetry. There is a chaste and
noble beauty in the forms of Greek and Roman architecture
which consorts well with the classic literature of those
countries. The compositions of Sir Walter, on the contrary,
resemble what he so much loved to describe&ndash;&ndash;the
rich and fantastic Gothic, at times ludicrously uncouth, at
times exquisitely beautiful. There are not finer passages
in all his writings than some of his architectural descriptions.
How exquisite is his <i>Melrose Abbey</i>,&ndash;&ndash;the external
view in the cold, pale moonshine,</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8216;</span>When buttress and buttress alternately<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Seemed formed of ebon and ivory;&#8217;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>internally, when the strange light broke from the wizard&#8217;s
tomb! Who, like Sir Walter, could draw a mullioned
window, with its &#8216;foliaged tracery,&#8217; its &#8216;freakish knots,&#8217; its
pointed and moulded arch, and its dyed and pictured
panes? We passed, of late, an hour amid the ruins of
Crichton, and scarce knew whether most to admire the fine
old castle itself, so worthy of its poet, or the exquisite picture
of it we found in <i>Marmion</i>.</p>
<p>Sir Walter&#8217;s monument would be a monument without
character, if it were other than Gothic. Still, however, we
have our fears for the effect. In portrait-painting there is
the full life-size, and a size much smaller, and both suit
nearly equally well, and appear equally natural; but the
intermediate sizes do not suit. Make the portrait just a
very little less than the natural size, and it seems not the
reduced portrait of a man, but the full-sized portrait of a
dwarf. Now a similar principle seems to obtain in Gothic
architecture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>The same design which strikes as beautiful in a model&ndash;&ndash;the
piece which, if executed in spar, and with a glass cover
over it, would be regarded as exquisitely tasteful&ndash;&ndash;would
impress, when executed on a large scale, as grand and magnificent
in the first degree. And yet this identical design,
in an intermediate size, would possibly enough be pronounced
a failure. Mediocrity in size is fatal to the Gothic,
if it be a richly ornamented Gothic; nor are we sure that
the noble design of Mr. Kemp is to be executed on a
scale sufficiently extended. We are rather afraid not, but
the result will show. Such a monument a hundred yards
in height would be one of the finest things perhaps in
Europe.</p>
<p>What has Sir Walter done for Scotland, to deserve so gorgeous
a monument? Assuredly not all he might have done;
and yet he has done much&ndash;&ndash;more, in some respects, than
any other merely literary man the country ever produced.
He has interested Europe in the national character, and in
some corresponding degree in the national welfare; and this
of itself is a very important matter indeed. Shakespeare&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
the only writer who, in the delineation of character,
takes precedence of the author of <i>Waverley</i>&ndash;&ndash;seems
to have been less intensely imbued with the love of country.
It is quite possible for a foreigner to luxuriate over his
dramas, as the Germans are said to do, without loving
Englishmen any the better in consequence, or respecting
them any the more. But the European celebrity of the
fictions of Sir Walter must have had the inevitable effect
of raising the character of his country,&ndash;&ndash;its character as a
country of men of large growth, morally and intellectually.
Besides, it is natural to think of foreigners as mere abstractions;
and hence one cause at least of the indifference with
which we regard them,&ndash;&ndash;an indifference which the first slight
misunderstanding converts into hostility. It is something
towards a more general diffusion of goodwill to be enabled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
to conceive of them as men with all those sympathies of
human nature, on which the corresponding sympathies lay
hold, warm and vigorous about them. Now, in this aspect
has Sir Walter presented his countrymen to the world.
Wherever his writings are known, a Scotsman can be no
mere abstraction; and in both these respects has the poet
and novelist deserved well of his country.</p>
<p>Within the country itself, too, his great nationality, like
that of Burns, has had a decidedly favourable effect. The
cosmopolism so fashionable among a certain class about the
middle of the last century, was but a mock virtue, and a
very dangerous one. The &#8216;citizen of the world,&#8217; if he be
not a mere pretender, is a man to be defined by negatives.
It is improper to say he loves all men alike: he is merely
equally indifferent to all. Nothing can be more absurd
than to oppose the love of country to the love of race.
The latter exists but as a wider diffusion of the former. Do
we not know that human nature, in its absolute perfection,
and blent with the absolute and infinite perfection of Deity,
indulged in the love of country? The Saviour, when He
took to Himself a human heart, wept over the city of His
fathers. Now, it is well that this spirit should be fostered,
not in its harsh and exclusive, but in its human and more
charitable form.</p>
<p>Liberty cannot long exist apart from it. The spirit of
war and aggression is yet abroad: there are laws to be
established, rights to be defended, invaders to be repulsed,
tyrants to be deposed. And who but the patriot is equal
to these things? How was the cry of &#8216;Scotland for ever&#8217;
responded to at Waterloo, when the Scots Greys broke
through a column of the enemy to the rescue of their countrymen,
and the Highlanders levelled their bayonets for the
charge! A people cannot survive without the national spirit,
except as slaves. The man who adds to the vigour of the
feeling at the same time that he lessens its exclusiveness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
deserves well of his country; and who can doubt that Sir
Walter has done so?</p>
<p>The sympathies of Sir Walter, despite his high Tory
predilections, were more favourable to the people as such
than those of Shakespeare. If the station be low among
the characters of the dramatist, it is an invariable rule that
the style of thinking and of sentiment is low also.</p>
<p>The humble wool-comber of Stratford-on-Avon, possessed
of a mind more capacious beyond comparison than the
minds of all the nobles and monarchs of the age, introduced
no such man as himself into his dramas&ndash;&ndash;no such
men as Bunyan or Burns,&ndash;&ndash;men low in place, but kingly
in intellect. Not so, however, the aristocratic Sir Walter.
There is scarcely a finer character in all his writings than
the youthful peasant of Glendearg, Halbert Glendinning,
afterwards the noble knight of Avenel, brave and wise, and
alike fitted to lead in the councils of a great monarch, or
to carry his banner in war. His brother Edward is scarcely
a lower character. And when was unsullied integrity in
a humble condition placed in an attitude more suited to
command respect and regard, than in the person of Jeanie
Deans?</p>
<p>A man of a lower nature, wrapt round by the vulgar
prejudices of rank, could not have conceived such a character:
he would have transferred to it a portion of his
own vulgarity, dressed up in a few borrowed peculiarities
of habit and phraseology. Even the character of Jeanie&#8217;s
father lies quite as much beyond the ordinary reach. Men
such as Sheridan, Fielding, and Foote, would have represented
him as a hypocrite&ndash;&ndash;a feeble and unnatural mixture
of baseness and cunning. Sir Walter, with all his prejudices
and all his antipathies, not only better knew the
national type, but he had a more comprehensive mind;
and he drew David Deans, therefore, as a man of stern
and inflexible integrity, and as thoroughly sincere in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
religion. Not but that in this department he committed
great and grievous mistakes. The main doctrine of revelation,
with its influence on character&ndash;&ndash;that doctrine of
regeneration which our Saviour promulgated to Nicodemus,
and enforced with the sanctity of an oath&ndash;&ndash;was a doctrine
of which he knew almost nothing. What has the first
place in all the allegories of Bunyan, has no place in the
fictions of Sir Walter. None of his characters exhibit the
change displayed in the life of the ingenious allegorist of
Elston, or of James Gardener, or of John Newton.</p>
<p>He found human nature a <i>terra incognita</i> when it came
under the influence of grace; and in this <i>terra incognita</i>,
the field in which he could only grope, not see, his way,
well-nigh all his mistakes were committed. But had his
native honesty been less, his mistakes would have been
greater.</p>
<p>He finds good even among Christians. What can be
finer than the character of his Covenanter&#8217;s widow, standing
out as it does in the most exceptionable of all his works,&ndash;&ndash;the
blind and desolate woman, meek and forgiving in her
utmost distress, who had seen her sons shot before her
eyes, and had then ceased to see more?</p>
<p>Our subject, however, is one which we must be content
not to exhaust.</p>

<a name='THE_LATE_MR_KEMP' id='THE_LATE_MR_KEMP'></a>
<h2>THE LATE MR. KEMP.</h2>
</div>
<p>The funeral of this hapless man of genius took place
yesterday, and excited a deep and very general interest,
in which there mingled the natural sorrow for high talent
prematurely extinguished, with the feeling of painful regret,
awakened by a peculiarly melancholy end. It was numerously
attended, and by many distinguished men. The
several streets through which it passed were crowded by
saddened spectators&ndash;&ndash;in some few localities very densely;
and the windows overhead were much thronged. At no
place was the crowd greater, except perhaps immediately
surrounding the burying-ground, than at the fatal opening
beside the Canal Basin, into which the unfortunate man had
turned from the direct road in the darkness of night, and
had found death at its termination. The scene of the
accident is a gloomy and singularly unpleasant spot. A
high wall, perforated by a low, clumsy archway, closes
abruptly what the stranger might deem a thoroughfare.
There is a piece of sluggish, stagnant water on the one
hand, thick and turbid, and somewhat resembling in form
and colour a broad muddy highway, lined by low walls;
not a tuft of vegetation is to be seen on its tame rectilinear
sides: all is slimy and brown, with here and there dank,
muddy recesses, as if for the frog and the rat; while on
the damp flat above, there lie, somewhat in the style of
the grouping in a Dutch painting, the rotting fragments
of canal passage-boats and coal-barges, with here and
there some broken-backed hulk, muddy and green, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
timbers peering out through the planking, and all around
heaps of the nameless lumber of a deserted boat-yard.
The low, clumsy archway is wholly occupied by a narrow
branch of the canal,&ndash;&ndash;brown and clay-like as the main
trunk, from which it strikes off at nearly right angles. It
struck us forcibly, in examining the place, that in the
uncertain light of midnight, the flat, dead water must have
resembled an ordinary cart-road, leading through the arched
opening in the direction of the unfortunate architect&#8217;s
dwelling; and certainly at this spot, just where he might
be supposed to have stepped upon the seeming road under
the fatal impression, was the body found.</p>
<p>It had been intended, as the funeral letters bore, to
inter the body of Mr. Kemp in the vault under the Scott
Monument,&ndash;&ndash;a structure which, erected to do honour to
the genius of one illustrious Scotsman, will be long recognised
as a proud trophy of the fine taste and vigorous
talent of another. The arrangement was not without precedent;
and had it been possible for Sir Walter to have
anticipated it, we do not think it would have greatly displeased
him. The Egyptian architect inscribed the name
of his kingly master on but the plaster of the pyramid,
while he engraved his own on the enduring granite underneath;
and so the name of the king has been lost, and
only that of the architect has survived. And there are,
no doubt, monuments in our own country which have been
transferred in some sort, and on a somewhat similar principle,
from their original object. There are fine statues
which reflect honour on but the sculptor that chiselled
them, and tombs and cenotaphs inscribed with names so
very obscure, that they give place in effect, if not literally,
like that of the Egyptian king, to the name of the architect
who reared them. Had the Scott Monument been erected,
like the monument of a neighbouring square, to express
a perhaps not very seemly gratitude for the services of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
some tenth-rate statesman, who procured places for his
friends, and who did not much else, it would have been
perilous to convert it into the tomb of a man of genius
like poor Kemp. It would have been perilous had it been
the monument of some mere <i>litterateur</i>. The <i>litterateur&#8217;s</i>
works would have disappeared from the public eye, while
that of the hapless architect would be for ever before it.
And it would be thus the architect, not the <i>litterateur</i>, that
would be permanently remembered. But the monument
of Sir Walter was in no danger; and Sir Walter himself
would have been quite aware of the fact. It would not
have displeased him, that in the remote future, when all
its buttresses had become lichened and grey, and generation
after generation had disappeared from around its base,
the story would be told&ndash;&ndash;like that connected in so many
of our older cathedrals with &#8216;prentice pillars&#8217; and &#8216;prentice
aisles&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;that the poor architect who had designed its exquisite
arches and rich pinnacles in honour of the Shakespeare
of Scotland, had met an untimely death when
engaged on it, and had found under its floor an appropriate
grave.</p>
<p>The intention, however, was not carried into effect. It
had been intimated in the funeral letters that the burial
procession should quit the humble dwelling of the architect&ndash;&ndash;for
a humble dwelling it is&ndash;&ndash;at half-past one. It
had been arranged, too, that the workmen employed at
the monument, one of the most respectable-looking bodies
of mechanics we ever saw, should carry the corpse to the
grave. They had gathered round the dwelling, a cottage
at Morningside, with a wreath of ivy nodding from the
wall; and the appearance of both it and them naturally
suggested that the poor deceased, originally one of themselves,
though he had risen, after a long struggle, into
celebrity, had not risen into affluence. Death had come
too soon. He had just attained his proper position&ndash;&ndash;just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
reached the upper edge of the table-land which his genius
had given him a right to occupy, and on which a competency
might be soon and honourably secured&ndash;&ndash;when a
cruel accident struck him down. The time specified for
the burial passed&ndash;&ndash;first one half-hour, and then another.
The assembled group wondered at the delay. And then
a gentleman from the dwelling-house came to inform them
that some interdict or protest, we know not what&ndash;&ndash;some,
we suppose, perfectly legal document&ndash;&ndash;had inhibited, at
this late hour, the interment of the body in the monument,
and that there was a grave in the course of being prepared
for it in one of the city churchyards.</p>

<h2>ANNIE M&#8217;DONALD AND THE FIFESHIRE FORESTER.</h2>
</div>
<p>It was the religion of Scotland that first developed the
intellect of the country. Nor would it be at all difficult to
show how. It is sufficiently easy to conceive the process
through which earnest feeling concentrated on the great
concerns of human destiny leads to earnest thinking, and
how thinking propagates itself in its abstract character as
such, even after the moving power which had first set its
wheels in motion has ceased to operate. The Reformation
was mainly a religious movement, but it was pregnant with
philosophy and the arts. The grand doctrine of justification
by faith, for which Luther and the other reformers contended,
was wonderfully linked, by the God from whom it
emanated, with all the great discoveries of modern science,
and not a few of the proudest triumphs of literature. It
drew along with it in the train of events, as if by a golden
chain, the philosophy of Bacon and Newton, and the poesy
of Milton and Shakespeare. But though the general truth
of the remark has been acknowledged, the connection
which it intimates&ndash;&ndash;a connection clearly referable to the
will of that adorable Being who has made &#8216;godliness
profitable for all things&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;has been too much lost sight of.
Religious belief, transmuted in its reflex influences into
mere intellectual activity, has too often assumed another
nature and name, and forgotten or disowned its origin;
and whatever is suited to remind us of the certainty of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
connection, or to illustrate the mode of its operations,
cannot be deemed other than important. From a consideration
of this character, we have been much pleased with a
little work just published, which, taking up a single family
in the humblest rank, shows, without any apparent intention
of the kind on the part of the writer, how the Christianity
of the country has operated on the popular intellect; and
we think we can scarce do better than introduce it to the
acquaintance of our readers. Most of them have perhaps
seen a memoir of one Annie M&#8217;Donald, published in Edinburgh
some eight or ten years ago. It is a humble production,
given chiefly, as the title-page intimates, in Annie&#8217;s own
words; and Annie ranked among the humblest of our people.
She had never seen a single day in school. When best and
most favourably circumstanced, she was the wife of a farm-servant,&ndash;&ndash;no
very exalted station surely; but still a lowlier
station awaited her, and she passed more than half a century
in widowhood. One of her daughters became the wife
of a poor labourer, her two grandchildren were labourers
also. It is not easy to imagine a humbler lot, without
crossing the line beyond which independence cannot be
achieved; and yet Annie was a noble-hearted matron, one
of the true aristocracy of the country. Her long life was a
protracted warfare&ndash;&ndash;a scene of privation, sorrow, and sore
trial; but she struggled bravely through, ever trusting in
God, dependent on Him, and Him only; and if the dignity
of human nature consist in integrity the most inflexible,
energy the most untiring, strong sound thinking, deep
devotional feeling, and a high-toned yet chastened spirit of
independence, then was there more true dignity to be
found in the humble cottage of Annie M&#8217;Donald, than in
half the proud mansions of the country. Many of our
readers must be acquainted, as we have said, with her
character, and some of the outlines of her story. Most of
them are acquainted, too, with the character of another very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
remarkable person, John Bethune, the Fifeshire Forester,&ndash;&ndash;a
man whose name, in all probability, they have never
associated with Annie M&#8217;Donald. He belongs to quite a
different class of persons. The venerable matron takes
her place among those cultivators of the moral nature who
live in close converse with their God, and on whom are re-stamped,
if we may so speak, the lineaments of the divine
image obliterated at the fall. The poet, too early lost,
ranks, on the other hand, among those hardy cultivators of
the intellectual nature who, among all the difficulties incident
to imperfect education, and a life of hardship and
labour, struggle into notice through the force of an innate
vigour, and impress the stamp of their mind on the literature
of their country. Much of the interest of the newly
published memoir before us arises from the connection
which it establishes between the matron and the poet. It
purports to be &#8216;A Sketch of the Life of Annie M&#8217;Donald, by
her Grandson, the late John Bethune.&#8217; And scarce any one
can peruse it without marking the powerful influence which
the high religious character of the grandmother exerted on
the intellectual character of her descendant. The nobility
of the humble family from which he sprung was derived
evidently from this source. That character, to borrow a
homely but forcible metaphor from Burns, was the sustaining
&#8216;stalk of carle hemp&#8217; which bore it up and kept it from
grovelling on the depressed level of its condition. How
very interesting a subject of thought and inquiry! A little
Highland girl, when tending cattle in the fields nearly a century
ago, was led, through divine grace, to &#8216;apprehend the
mercy of God in Christ,&#8217; and to close with His free offers of
salvation; and in the third generation we can see the effects
of the transaction, not only in the blameless life and the pure
sentiments of a true though humble poet, but in, also, the
manly vigour of his thinking, and the high degree of culture
which he was enabled to bestow on his intellectual faculties.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>The story of Annie M&#8217;Donald is such an one as a poet
of Wordsworth&#8217;s cast would delight to tell. She was born
in a remote and thinly inhabited district of the Highlands,
and lost her father, a Highland crofter, while yet an infant.
She was his youngest child, but the other members of the
family were all very young and helpless; and her poor
mother, a woman still in the prime of life, had to wander
with them into the low country, friendless and penniless, in
quest of employment. And employment after a weary pilgrimage
she at length succeeded in procuring from a hospitable
farmer in the parish of Kilmany, in Fifeshire. An
unoccupied hovel furnished her with a home; and here,
with hard labour, she reared her children, till they were
fitted to leave her one by one, and do something for themselves,
chiefly in the way of herding cattle. Annie grew up
to be employed like the rest; and when a little herd-girl in
the fields, &#8216;she frequently fell into strains of serious meditation,&#8217;
says her biographer, &#8216;on the works of God, and on
her own standing before Him.&#8217; Let scepticism assert what
it may, such is the nature of man. God has written on
every human heart the great truth of man&#8217;s responsibility;
and the simple, ignorant herd-girl could read it there, amid
the solitude of the fields. But the inscription seemed
fraught with terror: she was perplexed by alternate doubts
and fears, and troubled by wildly vivid imaginings during
the day, and by frightful dreams by night. Her mother
had been unable to send her to school, but she got
occasional lessons in the evenings from a fellow-servant;
and through the desultory assistance obtained in this way,
backed by her solitary efforts at self-instruction, she learned
to read. She must have deemed that an important day on
which she found she could at length converse with books;
and the books with which she most loved to discourse were
such as related to the spiritual state. She pored over the
Shorter Catechism, and acquainted herself with her Bible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
But for years together, at this period, she suffered much
distress of mind. Her imagination possessed a wild
activity, and the scenes and shapes which it was continually
calling up before her were all of horror and dismay&ndash;&ndash;the
place of the lost, the appalling forms with which
fancy invests the fallen spirits, the terrors of the last day,
and the dread throne of judgment. But a time of peace
and comfort came; and she was enabled to lay hold on
God in faith and hope as <i>her</i> God, through the all-sufficient
blood of the atonement. And this hold she never after
relinquished.</p>
<p>There was no pause in her humble toils. From her
early occupations in the fields, she passed in riper youth
to the labours of the farm-house; and at the age of
twenty-five experienced yet another change, in becoming
the wife of a farm-servant, a quiet man of solid character,
and whose religious views and feelings coincided with
her own. Her humble home was a solitary hut on the
uplands, far from even her nearest neighbours; but it
was her home, and she was happy. With the consent
of her husband, she took her aged mother under
her care, and succeeded in repaying more than the obligations
incurred in infancy; for her instructions, through
the blessing of God, were rendered apparently the means
of the old woman&#8217;s conversion. There were sorrows that
came to her even at the happiest, but they were mingled
with comfort. She lost one of her children by small-pox
at a very early age; and yet, very early as the age was,
evidence was not wanting in its death that the Psalmist
spoke with full meaning when he said that God can perfect
praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings. But
there was a deeper grief awaiting her. After a happy
union of twelve years, her husband was seized in the night
in their lonely shieling by a mortal distemper, at a time
when only herself and her young children were present,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
and ere assistance could be procured he expired. There
is something extremely touching in the details of this event,
as given by the poet, her grandson. They strongly show
how real an evil poverty is, in even the most favourable
circumstances, when the hour of distress comes. Cowper
ceased to envy the &#8220;&#8216;<i>peasant&#8217;s nest</i>&#8221; when he thought how
its solitude made scant the means of life.&#8217; We would
almost covet the hut of Annie M&#8217;Donald as described by
her grandson. &#8216;It appeared,&#8217; he says, &#8216;as if separated and
raised above the world by the cultureless and elevated solitude
on which it stood. Around it on every side were grey
rocks, peering out from among tufted grass, heath furze, and
many-coloured mosses; forming what had been, till more
recently&ndash;&ndash;when the whole was converted into a plantation&ndash;&ndash;a
rather extensive sheep-walk. For an extent equal to
more than half the horizon, the eye might stretch away to
the distant mountains, or repose on the intervening valleys;
and from the highest part of the hill, a little to the eastward,
the dark blue of the German Ocean was clearly
visible. It must have been a cheerful spot in the clear
sunny days of summer, when even heaths and moors look
gay&ndash;&ndash;when the deep blue of the hills seems as if softening
its tints to harmonize with the deep blue of the sky&ndash;&ndash;when
the hum of the bee is heard amid the heath, and the lark
high overhead. But it must have been a gloomy and miserable
solitude on that night when the husband of Annie lay
tossing in mortal agony, and no neighbour near to counsel
or assist, her weeping children around her, and with neither
lamp nor candle in the cottage. It was only by the &#8216;light
of a burning coal taken from the fire, and exchanged for
another as the flame waxed faint, that she was enabled to
watch the progress of the fatal malady, and to tell at what
time death set his unalterable seal on the pallid features
of her husband.&#8217;</p>
<p>Long years of incessant labour followed; her children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
were young and helpless, and her aged mother still with
her. She removed to another cottage, where she rented an
acre or two of land, that enabled her to keep a cow, and
gave her opportunity, as the place was situated beside a
considerable stream, of earning a small income as a bleacher
of home-made linen. The day, and not unfrequently the
night, was spent in toil; but she was strengthened to
endure, and so her children were bred up in hardy independence.
&#8216;During the weeks of harvest,&#8217; says her biographer,
&#8216;she was engaged as a reaper by the farmer from
whom she rented her little tenement; and when her day&#8217;s
work was done, while her fellow-labourers retired to rest,
she employed herself in reaping her own crops, or providing
grass for the cow, and often continued her toil by the
light of the harvest moon till it was almost midnight. After
a number of years thus spent, the expiration of the farmer&#8217;s
lease occasioned her removal. Her family were now grown
up; she could afford, in consequence, to have recourse to
means of subsistence which, if more scanty, were less laborious
than those which she had plied so long; and so, removing
to a neighbouring village, she earned a livelihood
for herself and her infirm mother by spinning carpet worsted
at twopence a-day, the common wages for a woman at that
period.&#8217; &#8216;The cottage which she now occupied,&#8217; we again
quote, &#8216;happened to be one of a number which the Countess
of Leven charitably kept for the accommodation of
poor people who were unable to pay a rent. She, however,
considered that she had no right to reckon herself among
this class, so long as it should please God to afford her
strength to provide for her own necessities; and therefore
she deemed it unjustifiable to deprive the truly indigent of
what had been intended exclusively for them. Influenced
by these motives, she removed at the next term to an
adjacent hamlet, and here her aged mother died.&#8217; We
need not minutely follow her after-course: it bore but one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
complexion to the end. She taught a school for many
years, and was of signal use to not a few of her pupils.
At an earlier period she experienced a desire to be able
to write. There was a friend at a distance whom she
wished to comfort, by suggesting to her those topics of
consolation which she herself had found of such solid use;
and the wish had suggested the idea. And so she did learn
to write. She took up a pen, and tried to imitate the letters
in her Bible; an acquaintance subsequently furnished
her with a copy of the alphabet commonly used in writing;
and such was all the instruction she ever received in an art
to which in after life she devoted a considerable portion of
her time, and in the exercise of which she derived no small
enjoyment. In extreme old age she was rendered unable
by deafness properly to attend to her school, and so, with
her characteristic conscientiousness, she threw it up; but
bodily strength was spared to her in a remarkable degree,
and her last years were not wasted in idleness. &#8216;Her
spinning-wheel was again eagerly resorted to; even outdoor
labour, when it could be obtained, was sometimes
adopted.&#8217; And the editor of the memoir before us&ndash;&ndash;Alexander
Bethune, the brother and biographer of John&ndash;&ndash;relates
that he recollects seeing her engaged in reaping, on
one occasion, when in her eighty-second year; and that on
the same field her favourite nephew the poet, at that time a
boy of ten, was also essaying the labours of the harvest. In
one of the simple but touching epistles which we owe to her
singularly acquired accomplishment of writing&ndash;&ndash;a letter to
one of her daughters&ndash;&ndash;we find her thus expressing herself:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8216;We finished our harvest last Monday, and here again
I have cause for thankfulness. I would desire to be doubly
thankful to God for enabling my old and withered arms to
use the sickle almost as well as they were wont to do when
I was young, and for the favourable weather and abundant
crop which in His mercy He has bestowed on us. But,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
my dear child, there is in very deed a more important harvest
before us. Oh! may God, for Christ&#8217;s sake, ripen us
by the sunshine of His Spirit for the sickle of death, and
stand by us in that trying hour, that we may be cut down
as a shock of corn which is fully ripe.&#8217;</p>
<p>Annie survived twelve years longer; for her life was prolonged
through three full generations. &#8216;In the intervals of
domestic duty, her book and her pen were her constant
companions.&#8217; &#8216;The process of committing her thoughts to
paper was rendered tedious, latterly, by the weakness and
tremor of her hand; and her mind not unfrequently outran
her pen, leaving blanks in her composition, which she did
not always detect so as to enable her to fill them up. And
this circumstance sometimes rendered her meaning a little
obscure. But with all these deficiencies, her letters were
generally appreciated by those to whom they were addressed.
Her conversation, too, was much sought after by
serious individuals in all ranks in society; and occasionally
it was pleasing to see the promiscuous visitors who met in
her lowly cottage laying aside for a time the fastidious distinctions
of birth and station, and humbly uniting in the
exercise of Christian love.&#8217; At length she could no longer
leave her bed: &#8216;her hearing was so much impaired, that
it was with the greatest difficulty she could be made to
understand what was said to her; and those friends who
came to visit her were frequently requested to sit down by
her bedside, where she might see their faces, though she
could no longer enjoy their conversation. After raising
herself to a convenient position, she generally addressed
them upon the importance of preparing for another world
while health and strength remained; and tried to direct
their attention to the merits and sufferings of the Saviour as
the only sure ground of hope upon which sinners could
rest their salvation in the hour of trial.&#8217; As for her own
departure, she &#8216;had a thousand reasons,&#8217; she said, &#8216;for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
wishing to be gone; but there was one reason which overbalanced
them all&ndash;&ndash;God&#8217;s time had not yet arrived.&#8217; But
at length it did arrive. &#8216;Lay me down,&#8217; she said, for the
irritability of her nervous system had rendered frequent
change of posture necessary, and her friends had just been
indulging her,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Lay me down; let me sleep my last sleep
in Jesus.&#8217; And these were her last words. Her grandson
John seems to have cherished, when a mere boy, years
before she died, the design of writing her story; and the
whole tone of his memoir (apparently one of his earlier prose
compositions) shows how thorough was the respect which
he entertained for her memory. She forms the subject, too,
of a copy of verses evidently of later production, and at
least equal to any he ever wrote, in which he affectingly
tells us how, when sadness and disease pressed upon the
springs of life, and he lingered in suspense and disappointment,
the hopes which she had so long cherished&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8216;</span>The glorious hopes which flattered not&ndash;&ndash;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Dawned on him by degrees.&#8217;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>He found the Saviour whom she had worshipped; and one
of the last subsidiary hopes in which he indulged ere he
bade the world farewell, was that in the place to which he
was going he should meet with his beloved grandmother.
We have occupied so much space with our narrative, brief
as it is, that we cannot follow up our original intention of
showing how, in principle, the intellectual history of Bethune
is an epitome of that of his country; but we must add that
it would be well if, in at least one important respect, the
history of his country resembled his history more. The
thoughtful piety of the grandmother prepared an atmosphere
of high-toned thought, in which the genius of the
grandson was fostered. It constituted, to vary the figure,
the table-land from which he arose; but how many of
a resembling class, and indebted in a similar way, have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
directed the influence of their writings to dissipate that
atmosphere&ndash;&ndash;to lower that table-land! We refer the reader
to the interesting little work from which we have drawn
our materials. It is edited by the surviving Bethune, the
brother and biographer of the poet, and both a vigorous
writer and a worthy man. There are several of the passages
which it comprises of his composition; among the
rest, the very striking passage with which the memoir concludes,
and in which he adds a few additional facts illustrative
of his grandmother&#8217;s character, and describes her
personal appearance. The description will remind our
readers of one of the more graphic pictures of Wordsworth,
that of the stately dame on whose appearance the poet
remarks quaintly, but significantly,</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'>&#8216;Old times are living there.&#8217;<br /></p>
</div>
<p>&#8216;From the date of her birth,&#8217; says Alexander Bethune,
&#8216;it will be seen that she (Annie M&#8217;Donald) was in her
ninety-fourth year at the time of her death. In person she
was spare; and ere toil and approaching age had bent her
frame, she must have been considerably above the middle
size. Even after she was far advanced in life, there was in her
appearance a rigidity of outline and a sinewy firmness which
told of no ordinary powers of endurance. There was much
of true benevolence in the cast of her countenance; while
the depth of her own Christian feelings gave an expression
of calm yet earnest sympathy to her eye, which was particularly
impressive. Limited as were her resources, she
had been a regular contributor to the Bible and Missionary
Societies for a number of years previous to her death. Nor
was she slow to minister to the necessities of others according
to her ability. Notwithstanding the various items thus
disposed of during the latter part of her life, she had saved
a small sum of money, which at her death was left to her
unmarried daughters.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>The touching description of the poet we must also subjoin.
No one can read it without feeling its truth, or
without being convinced that, to be thoroughly true in the
circumstances, was to be intensely poetical. The recollection
of such a relative affectionately retained was of itself
poetry.</p>

<h2>A HIGHLAND CLEARING.</h2>
</div>
<p>How quickly the years fly! One twelvemonth more, and it
will be a full quarter of a century since we last saw the wild
Highland valley so well described by Mr. Robertson in his
opening paragraphs.<a name='FNanchor_0017' id='FNanchor_0017'></a><a href='#Footnote_0017' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> And yet the recollection is as fresh
in our memory now as it was twenty years ago. The chill
winter night had fallen on the brown round hills and alder-skirted
river, as we turned from off the road that winds
along the Kyle of the Dornoch Frith into the bleak gorge
of Strathcarron. The shepherd&#8217;s cottage, in which we purposed
passing the night, lay high up in the valley, where the
lofty sides&ndash;&ndash;partially covered at that period by the remnants
of an ancient forest&ndash;&ndash;approach so near each other, and rise
so abruptly, that for the whole winter quarter the sun never
falls on the stream below. There were still some ten or
twelve miles of broken road before us. The moon in its
first quarter hung low over the hills, dimly revealing their
rough outline, and throwing its tinge of faint bronze on the
broken clumps of wood in the hollows. A keen frost had
set in; and a thick trail of fog-rime, raised by its influence
in the calm, and which at the height of some eighty or a
hundred feet hung over the river&ndash;&ndash;scarce less defined in
its margin than the river itself, for it winded wherever
the stream winded, and ran straight as an arrow wherever
the stream ran straight&ndash;&ndash;occupied the whole length of the
valley, like an enormous snake lying uncoiled in its den.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
The numerous turf cottages on either side were invisible
in the darkness, save that ever and anon the brief twinkle
of a light indicated their existence and their places. In a
recess of the stream the torch of some adventurous fisher
now gleamed red on rock and water, now suddenly disappeared,
eclipsed by the overhanging brushwood, or by
some jutting angle of the bank. The distant roar of the
stream mingled sullenly in the calm, with its nearer and
hoarser dash, as it chafed on the ledges below, filling the
air with a wild music, that seemed the appropriate voice of
the impressive scenery from amid which it arose. It was
late ere we reached the shepherd&#8217;s cottage&ndash;&ndash;a dark, raftered,
dimly-lighted building of turf and stone. The weather for
several weeks before had been rainy and close, and the
flocks of the inmate had been thinned by the common
scourge of the sheep-farmer at such seasons on marshy and
unwholesome farms. The rafters were laden with skins
besmeared with blood, that dangled overhead to catch the
conservative influences of the smoke; and on a rude plank
table below there rose two tall pyramids of dark-coloured
joints of braxy mutton, heaped up each on a corn riddle.
The shepherd&ndash;&ndash;a Highlander of colossal proportions, but
hard and thin, and worn by the cares and toils of at least
sixty winters&ndash;&ndash;sat moodily beside the fire. The state of his
flocks was not particularly cheering; and he had, besides,
seen a vision of late, he said, that filled his mind with
strange forebodings. He had gone out after nightfall on the
previous evening to a dank hollow on the hill-side, in which
many of his flock had died; the rain had ceased a few
hours before, and a smart frost had set in, that, as on this
second evening, filled the whole valley with a wreath of
silvery vapour, dimly lighted by the thin fragment of a
moon that appeared as if resting at the time on the hill-top.
The wreath stretched out its grey folds beneath him, for he
had climbed half-way up the acclivity, when suddenly what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
seemed the figure of a man in heated metal&ndash;&ndash;the figure of
a brazen man brought to a red heat in a furnace&ndash;&ndash;sprang
up out of the darkness; and after stalking over the surface
of the fog for a few seconds&ndash;&ndash;in which, however, it traversed
the greater part of the valley&ndash;&ndash;as suddenly disappeared,
leaving an evanescent trail of flame behind it. There could
be little doubt that the old shepherd had merely seen one
of those shooting lights that in mountain districts, during
unsettled weather, so frequently startle the night traveller,
and that some peculiarity of form in the meteor had been
exaggerated by the obscuring influence of the frost-rime
and the briefness of the survey; but the apparition had
filled his whole mind, as one of strange and frightful portent
from the spiritual world. And often since that night has it
returned to us in recollection, as a vision in singular keeping
with the wild valley which it traversed, and the credulous
melancholy of the solitary shepherd, its only witness,&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<p>By much the greater part of Strathcarron, in those days,
was in the possession of its ancient inhabitants; and we
learn from the description of Mr. Robertson, that it has
since undergone scarce any change. &#8216;Strathcarron,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;is still in the old state.&#8217; Throughout its whole
extent the turf cottages of the aborigines rise dark and
thick as heretofore, from amid their irregular patches of
potatoes and corn. But in an adjacent glen, through
which the Calvie works its headlong way to the Carron,
that terror of the Highlanders, a summons of removal, has
been served within the last few months on a whole community;
and the graphic sketch of Mr. Robertson relates
both the peculiar circumstances in which it has been issued,
and the feelings which it has excited. We find from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
testimony, that the old state of things which is so immediately
on the eve of being broken up in this locality,
lacked not a few of those sources of terror to the proprietary
of the country, that are becoming so very formidable
to them in the newer states. A spectral poor-law sits
by our waysides, wrapped up in death-flannels of the
English cut, and shakes its skinny hand at the mansion-houses
of our landlords,&ndash;&ndash;vision beyond comparison more
direfully portentous than the apparition seen by the lone
shepherd of Strathcarron. But in the Highlands, at least,
it is merely the landlord of the new and improved state of
things&ndash;&ndash;the landlord of widespread clearings and stringent
removal-summonses&ndash;&ndash;that it threatens. The existing poor-law
in Glencalvie is a self-enforcing law, that rises direct
out of the unsophisticated sympathies of the Highland
heart, and costs the proprietary nothing. &#8216;The constitution
of society in the glen,&#8217; says Mr. Robertson, &#8216;is remarkably
simple. Four heads of families are bound for the whole rental
of &pound;55, 13s. a year; the number of souls is about ninety.
Sixteen cottages pay rent; three cottages are occupied by old
lone women, who pay no rent, and who have a grace from
the others for the grazing of a few goats or sheep, by which
they live. This self-working poor-law system,&#8217; adds Mr.
Robertson, &#8216;is supported by the people themselves; the
laird, I am informed, never gives anything to it.&#8217; Now there
must be at least some modicum of good in such a state of
things, however old-fashioned; and we are pretty sure such
of our English neighbours as leave their acres untilled year
after year, to avoid the crushing pressure of the statute-enforced
poor-law that renders them not worth the tilling,
would be somewhat unwilling, were the state made theirs,
to improve it away. Nor does it seem a state&ndash;&ndash;with all its
simplicity, and all its perhaps blameable indifferency to
modern improvement&ndash;&ndash;particularly hostile to the development
of mind or the growth of morals. &#8216;The people of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
Amat and Glencalvie themselves supported a teacher for
the education of their children,&#8217; says Mr. Robertson. &#8216;The
laird,&#8217; he adds, &#8216;has never lost a farthing of rent. In bad
years, such as 1836 or 1837, the people may have required
the favour of a few weeks&#8217; delay, but they are now not a
single farthing in arrears.&#8217;</p>
<p>Mr. Robertson gives us the tragedy of a clearing in its
first act. We had lately the opportunity of witnessing the
closing scene in the after-piece, by which a clearing more
than equally extensive has been followed up, and which
bids fair to find at no distant day many counterparts in the
Highlands of Scotland. Rather more than twenty years
ago, the wild, mountainous island of Rum, the home of
considerably more than five hundred souls, was divested
of all its inhabitants, to make way for one sheep-farmer
and eight thousand sheep. It was soon found, however,
that there are limits beyond which it is inconvenient to
depopulate a country on even the sheep-farm system: the
island had been rendered too thoroughly a desert for the
comfort of the tenant; and on the occasion of a clearing
which took place in a district of Skye, and deprived of their
homes many of the old inhabitants, some ten or twelve
families of the number were invited to Rum, and may now
be found squatting on the shores of the only bay of the
island, on a strip of unprofitable morass. But the whole of
the once peopled interior remains a desert, all the more
lonely in its aspect from the circumstance that the solitary
glens, with their green, plough-furrowed patches, and their
ruined heaps of stone, open upon shores every whit as
solitary as themselves, and that the wide untrodden sea
stretches drearily around. We spent a long summer&#8217;s day
amidst its desert recesses, and saw the sun set behind its
wilderness of pyramidal hills. The evening was calm and
clear; the armies of the insect world were sporting by
millions in the light; a brown stream that ran through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
valley at our feet yielded an incessant poppling sound from
the myriads of fish that were incessantly leaping in the
pools, beguiled by the quick glancing wings of green and
gold that incessantly fluttered over them; the half-effaced
furrows borrowed a richer hue from the yellow light of sunset;
the broken cottage-walls stood up more boldly prominent
on the hill-side, relieved by the lengthening shadows;
along a distant hill-side there ran what seemed the ruins of
a grey stone fence, erected, says tradition, in a very remote
age to facilitate the hunting of deer: all seemed to bespeak
the place a fitting habitation for man, and in which not only
the necessaries, but not a few also of the luxuries of life, might
be procured; but in the entire prospect not a man nor a
man&#8217;s dwelling could the eye command. The landscape was
one without figures. And where, it may be asked, was the
one tenant of the island for whose sake so many others had
been removed? We found his house occupied by a humble
shepherd, who had in charge the wreck of his property,&ndash;&ndash;property
no longer his, but held for the benefit of his
creditors. The great sheep-farmer had gone down under
circumstances of very general bearing, and on whose after
development, when in their latent state, improving landlords
had failed to calculate; the island itself was in the
market, and a report went current at the time that it was
on the eve of being purchased by some wealthy Englishman,
who purposed converting it into a deer-forest. The cycle&ndash;&ndash;which
bids fair to be that of the Highlands generally&ndash;&ndash;had
already revolved in the depopulated island of Rum.</p>
<p>We have said that the sheep-farmer had gone down, in
this instance, under adverse circumstances of very extensive
bearing. In a beautiful transatlantic poem, a North
American Indian is represented as visiting by night the
tombs of his fathers, now surrounded, though reared in the
depths of a forest, by the cultivated farms and luxurious
dwellings of the stranger, and there predicting that the race
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
by which <i>his</i> had been supplaced should be in turn cast out
of their possessions. His fancy on the subject is a wild
one, though not unfitted for the poet. The streams, he
said, were yielding a lower murmur than of old, and rolling
downwards a decreasing volume; the springs were less
copious in their supplies; the land, shorn of its forests, was
drying up under the no longer softened influence of summer
suns. Yet a few ages more, and it would spread out all
around an arid and barren wilderness, unfitted, like the
deserts of the East, to be a home of man. The fancy, we
repeat, though a poetic, is a wild one; but the grounds
from which we infer that the clearers of the Highlands&ndash;&ndash;the
supplanters of the Highlanders&ndash;&ndash;are themselves to be
cleared and supplanted in turn, is neither wild nor poetic.
The voice which predicts in the case is a voice, not of
shrinking rivulets nor failing springs, but of the &#8216;Cloth
Hall&#8217; in Leeds, and of the worsted factories of Bradford
and Halifax. Most of our readers must be aware that
the great woollen trade of Britain divides into two main
branches&ndash;&ndash;its woollen cloth manufacture, and its worsted
and stuff manufactures: and in both these the estimation
in which British wool is held has mightily sunk of late
years, never apparently to rise again; for it has sunk, not
through any caprice of fashion, but in the natural progress
of improvement. Mr. Dodd, in his interesting little work
on the <i>Textile Manufactures of Great Britain</i>, refers incidentally
to the fact, in drawing a scene in the Cloth Hall
of Leeds, introduced simply for the purpose of showing at
how slight an expense of time and words business is transacted
in this great mart of trade. &#8216;All the sellers,&#8217; says Mr.
Dodd, &#8216;know all the buyers; and each buyer is invited, as
he passes along, to look at some &#8220;olives,&#8221; or &#8220;browns,&#8221; or
&#8220;pilots,&#8221; or &#8220;six quarters,&#8221; or &#8220;eight quarters;&#8221; and the
buyer decides in a wonderfully short space of time whether
it will answer his purpose to purchase or not. &#8220;Mr. A., just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
look at these olives.&#8221; &#8220;How much?&#8221; &#8220;Six and eight.&#8221;
&#8220;Too high.&#8221; Mr. A. walks on, and perhaps a neighbouring
clothier draws his attention to a piece, or &#8220;end,&#8221; of cloth.
&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; &#8220;Five and three.&#8221; &#8220;Too low.&#8221; The
&#8220;too high&#8221; relates, as may be supposed, to the price per
yard; whereas the &#8220;too low&#8221; means that the quality of the
cloth is lower than the purchaser requires. Another seller
accosts him with &#8220;Will this suit you, Mr. A.?&#8221; &#8220;<i>Any
English wool?</i>&#8221; &#8220;<i>Not much; it is nearly all foreign</i>;&#8221; a
question and answer which exemplify the disfavour into
which English wool has fallen in the cloth trade. But it is
not the cloth trade alone in which it has fallen into disfavour.
The rapid extension of the worsted manufacture in
this country,&#8217; says the same writer in another portion of his
work, &#8216;is very remarkable. So long as efforts were made
by English wool-growers to compel the use of the English
wool in cloth-making&ndash;&ndash;efforts which the Legislature for
many years sanctioned by legal enactments&ndash;&ndash;the worsted
fabrics made were chiefly of a coarse and heavy kind, such
as &#8220;camlets;&#8221; but when the wool trade was allowed to flow
into its natural channels by the removal of restrictions, the
value of all the different kinds of wool became appreciated,
and each one was appropriated to purposes for which it
seemed best fitted. The wool of one kind of English
sheep continued in demand for hosiery and coarse worsted
goods; and the wool of the Cashmere and Angora goats
came to be imported for worsted goods of finer quality.&#8217;
The colonist and the foreign merchant have been brought
into the field, and the home producer labours in vain to
compete with them on what he finds unequal terms.</p>
<p>Hence the difficulties which, in a season of invigorated
commerce and revived trade, continue to bear on the
British wool-grower, and which bid fair <i>to clear</i> him from
the soil which he divested of the original inhabitants. Every
new sheep-rearing farm that springs up in the colonies&ndash;&ndash;whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
in Australia, or New Zealand, or Van Diemen&#8217;s
Land, or Southern Africa&ndash;&ndash;sends him its summons of removal
in the form of huge bales of wool, lower in price and better
in quality than he himself can produce. The sheep-breeders
of New Holland and the Cape threaten to avenge the Rosses
of Glencalvie. But to avenge is one thing, and to right
another. The comforts of our poor Highlander have been
deteriorating, and his position lowering, for the last three
ages, and we see no prospect of improvement.</p>
<p>&#8216;For a century,&#8217; says Mr. Robertson, &#8216;their privileges have
been lessening: they dare not now hunt the deer, or shoot
the grouse or the blackcock; they have no longer the range
of the hills for their cattle and their sheep; they must not
catch a salmon in a stream: in earth, air, and water, the
rights of the laird are greater, and the rights of the people
are smaller, than they were in the days of their forefathers.
Yet, forsooth, there is much talk of philosophers of the
progress of democracy as a progress to equality of conditions
in our day! One of the ministers who accompanied me
had to become bound for law expenses to the amount of
&pound;20, inflicted on the people for taking a log from the
forest for their bridge,&ndash;&ndash;a thing they and their fathers had
always done unchallenged.&#8217;</p>
<p>One eloquent passage more, and we have done. It is
thus we find Mr. Robertson, to whose intensely interesting
sketch we again direct the attention of the reader, summing
up the case of the Rosses of Glencalvie:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8216;The father of the laird of Kindeace bought Glencalvie.
It was sold by a Ross two short centuries ago. The swords
of the Rosses of Glencalvie did their part in protecting this
little glen, as well as the broad lands of Pitcalnie, from the
ravages and the clutches of hostile septs. These clansmen
bled and died in the belief that every principle of honour
and morals secured their descendants a right to subsisting
on the soil. The chiefs and their children had the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
charter of the sword. Some Legislatures have made the
right of the people superior to the right of the chief; British
law-makers have made the rights of the chief everything, and
those of their followers nothing. The ideas of the morality
of property are in most men the creatures of their interests
and sympathies. Of this there cannot be a doubt, however:
the chiefs would not have had the land at all, could the
clansmen have foreseen the present state of the Highlands&ndash;&ndash;their
children in mournful groups going into exile&ndash;&ndash;the
faggot of legal myrmidons in the thatch of the feal cabin&ndash;&ndash;the
hearths of their loves and their lives the green sheep-walks
of the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8216;Sad it is, that it is seemingly the will of our constituencies
that our laws shall prefer the few to the many. Most
mournful will it be, should the clansmen of the Highlands
have been cleared away, ejected, exiled, in deference to
a political, a moral, a social, and an economical mistake,&ndash;&ndash;a
suggestion not of philosophy, but of mammon,&ndash;&ndash;a system
in which the demon of sordidness assumed the shape of the
angel of civilisation and of light.&#8217;</p>

<h2>THE POET MONTGOMERY.</h2>
</div>
<p>The reader will find in our columns a report, as ample as
our limits have allowed, of the public breakfast given in
Edinburgh on Wednesday last<a name='FNanchor_0018' id='FNanchor_0018'></a><a href='#Footnote_0018' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> to our distinguished countryman
James Montgomery, and his friend the missionary
Latrobe. We have rarely shared in a more agreeable entertainment,
and have never listened to a more pleasing or
better-toned address than that in which the poet ran over
some of the more striking incidents of his early life. It was
in itself a poem, and a very fine one. An old and venerable
man returning to his native country after an absence of
sixty years&ndash;&ndash;after two whole generations had passed away,
and the grave had closed over almost all his contemporaries&ndash;&ndash;would
be of itself a matter of poetical interest, even were
the aged visitor a person of but the ordinary cast of thought
and depth of feeling. How striking the contrast between
the sunny, dream-like recollections of childhood to such an
individual, and the surrounding realities&ndash;&ndash;between the scenes
and figures on this side the wide gulf of sixty years, and the
scenes and figures on that: yonder, the fair locks of infancy,
its bright, joyous eyes, and its speaking smiles; here, the
grey hairs and careworn wrinkles of rigid old age, tottering
painfully on the extreme verge of life! But if there attaches
thus a poetic interest to the mere circumstances of such a
visit, how much more, in the present instance, from the
character of the visitor,&ndash;&ndash;a man whose thoughts and feelings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
tinted by the warm hues of imagination, retain in his old
age all the strength and freshness of early youth!</p>
<p>Hogg, when first introduced to Wilkie, expressed his
gratification at finding him so young a man. We experienced
a similar feeling on first seeing the poet Montgomery.
He can be no young man, who, looking backwards across
two whole generations, can recount from recollection, like
Nestor of old, some of the occurrences of the third. But
there is a green old age, in which the spirits retain their
buoyancy, and the intellect its original vigour; and the
whole appearance of the poet gives evidence that his evening
of life is of this happy and desirable character. His
appearance speaks of antiquity, but not of decay. His
locks have assumed a snowy whiteness, and the lofty and
full-arched coronal region exhibits what a brother poet has
well termed the &#8216;clear bald polish of the honoured head;&#8217;
but the expression of the countenance is that of middle life.
It is a clear, thin, speaking countenance: the features are
high; the complexion fresh, though not ruddy; and age has
failed to pucker either cheek or forehead with a single
wrinkle. The spectator sees at a glance that all the poet
still survives&ndash;&ndash;that James Montgomery in his sixty-fifth year
is all that he ever was. The forehead, rather compact than
large, swells out on either side towards the region of ideality,
and rises high, in a fine arch, into what, if phrenology
speak true, must be regarded as an amply developed organ
of veneration. The figure is quite as little touched by age
as the face. It is well but not strongly made, and of the
middle size; and yet there is a touch of antiquity about it
too, derived, however, rather from the dress than from any
peculiarity in the person itself. To a plain suit of black
Mr. Montgomery adds the voluminous breast ruffles of the
last age&ndash;&ndash;exactly such things as, in Scotland at least, the
fathers of the present generation wore on their wedding-days.
These are perhaps but small details; but we notice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
them just because we have never yet met with any one who
took an interest in a celebrated name, without trying to
picture to himself the appearance of the individual who
bore it.</p>
<p>There are some very pleasing incidents beautifully related
in the address of Mr. Montgomery. It would have
been false taste and delicacy in such a man to have forborne
speaking of himself. His return, after an absence
equal to the term of two full generations, to his native
cottage, is an incident exquisitely poetic. He finds his
father&#8217;s humble chapel converted into a workshop, and
strangers sit beside the hearth that had once been his
mother&#8217;s. And where were that father and mother? Their
bones moulder in a distant land, where the tombstones cast
no shadow when the fierce sun looks down at noon upon
their graves. &#8216;Taking their lives in their hands,&#8217; they had
gone abroad to preach Christ to the poor enslaved negro,
for whose soul at that period scarce any one cared save the
United Brethren; and in the midst of their labours of piety
and love, they had fallen victims to the climate. He passed
through the cottage and the workshop, calling up the dream-like
recollections of his earliest scene of existence, and recognising
one by one the once familiar objects within. One
object he failed to recognise. It was a small tablet fixed in
the wall. He went up to it, and found it intimated that
James Montgomery the poet had been born there. Was it
not almost as if one of the poets or philosophers of a former
time had lighted, on revisiting the earth as a disembodied
spirit, on his own monument? Of scarce less interest is his
anecdote of Monboddo. The parents of the poet had gone
abroad, as we have said, and their little boy was left with
the Brethren at Fulneck, a Moravian settlement in the sister
kingdom. He was one of their younger scholars at a time
when Lord Monboddo, still so well known for his great
talents and acquirements, and his scarce less marked eccentricities,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
visited the settlement, and was shown, among other
things, their little school. His Lordship stood among the
boys, coiling and uncoiling his whip on the floor, and engaged
as if in counting the nail-heads in the boarding. The
little fellows were all exceedingly curious; none of them
had ever seen a real live lord before, and Monboddo was a
very strange-looking lord indeed. He wore a large, stiff,
bushy periwig, surmounted by a huge, odd-looking hat; his
very plain coat was studded with brass buttons of broadest
disk, and his voluminous inexpressibles were of leather.
And there he stood, with his grave, absent face bent downwards,
drawing and redrawing his whip along the floor, as
the Moravian, his guide, pointed out to his notice boy after
boy. &#8216;And this,&#8217; said the Moravian, coming at length to
young Montgomery, &#8216;is a countryman of your Lordship&#8217;s.&#8217;
His Lordship raised himself up, looked hard at the little
fellow, and then shaking his huge whip over his head, &#8216;Ah,&#8217;
he exclaimed, &#8216;I hope his country will have no reason to be
ashamed of him.&#8217; &#8216;The circumstance,&#8217; said the poet, &#8216;made
a deep impression on my mind; and I determined&ndash;&ndash;I trust
the resolution was not made in vain&ndash;&ndash;I determined in that
moment that my country should not have reason to be
ashamed of me.&#8217;</p>
<p>Scotland has no reason to be ashamed of James Montgomery.
Of all her poets, there is not one of equal power,
whose strain has been so uninterruptedly pure, or whose
objects have been so invariably excellent. The child of
the Christian missionary has been the poet of Christian
missions. The parents laid down their lives in behalf of
the enslaved and perishing negro; the son, in strains the
most vigorous and impassioned, has raised his generous
appeal to public justice in his behalf. Nor has the appeal
been in vain. All his writings bear the stamp of the Christian;
many of them&ndash;&ndash;embodying feelings which all the truly
devout experience, but which only a poet could express&ndash;&ndash;have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
been made vehicles for addressing to the Creator the
emotions of many a grateful heart; and, employed chiefly
on themes of immortality, they promise to outlive not only
songs of intellectually a lower order, but of even equal
powers of genius, into whose otherwise noble texture sin
has introduced the elements of death.</p>

<h2>CRITICISM&ndash;&ndash;INTERNAL EVIDENCE.</h2>
</div>
<p>The reader must have often remarked, in catalogues of the
writings of great authors&ndash;&ndash;such as Dr. Johnson, and the
Rev. John Cumming, of the Scotch Church, London&ndash;&ndash;that
while some of the pieces are described as <i>acknowledged</i>, the
genuineness of others is determined merely by <i>internal
evidence</i>. We know, for instance, that the Doctor wrote the
<i>English Dictionary</i>, not only because no other man in the
world at the time could have written it, but also because he
affixed his name to the title-page. We know, too, that he
wrote some of the best of Lord Chatham&#8217;s earlier speeches,
just because he said so, and pointed out the very garret in
Fleet Street in which they had been written. But it is from
other data we conclude that, during his period of obscurity
and distress, he wrote prefaces for the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i>,
for some six or seven years together,&ndash;&ndash;data derived
exclusively from a discriminating criticism; and his claim
to the authorship of <i>Taylor&#8217;s Sermons</i> rests solely on the
vigorous character of the thinking displayed in these compositions,
and the marked peculiarities of their style. Now,
in exactly the same way in which we know that Johnson
wrote the speeches and the Dictionary, do we know that the
Rev. John Cumming drew up an introductory essay to the
liturgy of a Church that never knew of a liturgy, and that
he occasionally contributes tales to morocco annuals, wonderful
enough to excite the astonishment of ordinary readers.
To these compositions he affixes his name,&ndash;&ndash;a thing very few
men would have the courage to do; and thus are we assured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
of their authorship. But there are other compositions to
which he does not affix his name, and it is from internal
evidence alone that these can be adjudged to him: it is
from internal evidence alone, for instance, that we can conclude
him to be the author of the article on the Scottish
Church question which has appeared in <i>Fraser&#8217;s Magazine</i>
for the present month.</p>
<p>May we crave leave to direct the attention of the reader
for a very few minutes to the grounds on which we decide?
It is of importance, as Johnson says of Pope, that no part
of so great a writer should be suffered to be lost, and a
little harmless criticism may have the effect of sharpening
the faculties.</p>
<p>There is a class of Scottish ministers in the present day,
who, though they detest show and coxcombry, have yet a
very decided leaning to the picturesque ceremonies of the
Episcopal Church. They never weary of apologizing to
our southern neighbours for what they term the baldness of
our Presbyterian ritual, or in complaining of it to ourselves.
It was no later than last Sunday that Dr. Muir sorrowed
in his lecture over the &#8216;stinted arrangement in the Presbyterian
service, that admits of no audible response from the
people;&#8217; and all his genteeler hearers, sympathizing with
the worthy man, felt how pleasant a thing it would be were
the congregation permitted to do for him in the church
what the Rev. Mr. Macfarlane, erst of Stockbridge, does
for him in the presbytery. Corporal Trim began one of
his stories on one occasion, by declaring &#8216;that there was
once an unfortunate king of Bohemia;&#8217; and when Uncle
Toby, interrupting him with a sigh, exclaimed, &#8216;Ah, Corporal
Trim, and was he unfortunate?&#8217; &#8216;Yes, your honour,&#8217;
readily replied Trim; &#8216;he had a great love of ships and seaports,
and yet, as your honour knows, there was ne&#8217;er a
ship nor a seaport in all his dominions.&#8217; Now this semi-Episcopalian
class are unfortunate after the manner of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
king of Bohemia. The objects of their desire lie far beyond
the Presbyterian territories. They are restricted to one
pulpit, they are limited to one dress; they have actually to
read and preach from the same footboard; they are prohibited
the glories of white muslin; liturgy have they none.
No audible responses arise from the congregation; the precentor
is silent, save when he sings; their churches are
organless; and though they set themselves painfully to
establish their claim to the succession apostolical, the Hon.
Mr. Percevals of the Church which they love and admire
see no proof in their evidence, and look down upon them
as the mere preaching laymen of a sectarian corporation.</p>
<p>Thrice unfortunate men! What were the unhappinesses
of the king of Bohemia, compared with the sorrows of these
humble but rejected followers of Episcopacy!</p>
<p>Now, among this highly respectable but unhappy class,
the Rev. John Cumming, of the Scotch Church, London,
stands pre-eminent. So grieved was Queen Mary of
England by the loss of Calais, that she alleged the very
name of the place would be found written on her heart after
her death. The words that have the best chance of being
found inscribed on the heart of the Rev. Mr. Cumming are,
bishop, liturgy, apostolical succession, burial service, organ,
and surplice. The ideas attached to these vocables pervade
his whole style, and form from their continual recurrence
a characteristic portion of it. They tumble up and
down in his mind like the pieces of painted glass in a
kaleidoscope, and present themselves in new combinations
at every turn. His last acknowledged composition was a
wonderful tale which appeared in the <i>Protestant Annual</i> for
the present year, and&ndash;&ndash;strange subject for such a writer&ndash;&ndash;it
purported to be a <i>Tale of the Covenant</i>. Honest Peter
Walker had told the same story, that of John Brown of
Priesthill, about a century and a half ago; but there had
been much left for Mr. Cumming to discover in it of which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
the poor pedlar does not seem to have had the most distant
conception.</p>
<p>Little did Peter know that John Brown&#8217;s favourite minister
&#8216;held the sacred and apostolical succession of the
Scottish priesthood.&#8217; Little would he have thought of
apologizing to the English reader for &#8216;the antique and
ballad verses&#8217; of our metrical version of the Psalms. Indeed,
so devoid was he of learning, that he could scarce
have valued at a sufficiently high rate the doctrines of
Oxford; and so little gifted with taste, that he would have
probably failed to appreciate the sublimities of Brady and
Tate. Nor could Peter have known that the &#8216;liturgy of
the heart&#8217; was in the Covenanter&#8217;s cottage, and that the
&#8216;litany&#8217; of the spirit breathed from his evening devotions.
But it is all known to the Rev. Mr. Cumming. He knows,
too, that there were sufferings and privations endured by
the persecuted Presbyterians of those days, of which writers
of less ingenuity have no adequate conception; that they
were forced to the wild hill-sides, where they could have no
&#8216;organs,&#8217; and compelled to bury their dead without the
solemnities of the funeral service. Unhappy Covenanters!
It is only now that your descendants are beginning to learn
the extent of your miseries. Would that it had been your
lot to live in the days of the Rev. John Cumming of the
Scottish Church, London!</p>
<p>He would assuredly have procured for you the music-box
of some wandering Italian, and gone away with you to the
wilds to mingle exquisite melody with your devotions,
qualifying with the sweetness of his tones the &#8216;antique and
ballad&#8217; rudeness of your psalms; nor would he have failed
to furnish you with a liturgy, by means of which you could
have interred your dead in decency. Had such been the
arrangement, no after writer could have remarked, as the
Rev. Mr. Cumming does now, that no &#8216;pealing organ&#8217;
mingled &#8216;its harmony of bass, tenor, treble, and soprano&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
when you sung, or have recorded the atrocious fact, that
not only was John Brown of Priesthill shot by Claverhouse,
but actually buried by his friends without the funeral service.
And how striking and affecting an incident would it not
form in the history of the persecution, could it now be told,
that when surprised by the dragoons, the good Mr. Cumming
fled over hill and hollow with the box on his back, turning
the handle as he went, and urging his limbs to their utmost
speed, lest the Episcopalian soldiery should bring him back
and make him a bishop!</p>
<p>It is partly from the more than semi-Episcopalian character
of this gentleman&#8217;s opinions, partly from the inimitable
felicities of his style, and partly from one or two peculiar
incidents in his history which lead to a particular tone of
remark, that we infer him to be the writer of the article in
<i>Fraser</i>.</p>
<p>We may be of course mistaken, but the internal evidence
seems wonderfully strong. The Rev. Mr. Cumming, though
emphatically powerful in declamation, has never practised
argument,&ndash;&ndash;a mean and undignified art, which he leaves to
men such as Mr. Cunningham, just as the genteel leave the
art of boxing to the commonalty; and in grappling lately
with a strong-boned Irish Presbyterian, skilful of fence, he
caught, as gentlemen sometimes do, a severe fall, and
began straightway to characterize Irish Presbyterians as a
set of men very inferior indeed. Now the writer in <i>Fraser</i>
has a fling <i>&agrave; la Cumming</i> at the Irish Presbyterians. Popular
election has, it seems, done marvellously little for them;
with very few exceptions, their &#8216;ministry&#8217; is neither &#8216;erudite,
influential, nor accomplished,&#8217; and their Church &#8216;exhibits
the symptoms of heart disease.&#8217; Depend on it, some stout
Irish Presbyterian has entailed the shame of defeat on the
writer in <i>Fraser</i>. Mr. Cumming, in his tale, adverts to the
majority of the Scottish Church as &#8216;radical subverters of
Church and State, who claim the Covenanters as precedents
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
for a course of conduct from which the dignified Henderson,
the renowned Gillespie, the learned Binning, the laborious
Denham, the heavenly-minded Rutherford, the religious
Wellwood, the zealous Cameron, and the prayerful Peden,
would have revolted in horror.&#8217; The writer of the article
brings out exactly the same sentiment, though not quite so
decidedly, in what Meg Dodds would have termed a grand
style of language. At no time, he asserts, did non-intrusion
exist in the sense now contended for in Scotland; at no
time might not qualified ministers be thrust upon reclaiming
parishes by the presbytery: and as for the vetoists, they are
but wild radicals, who are to be &#8216;classified by the good sense
of England with those luminaries of the age, Dan O&#8217;Connell,
John Frost, and others of that ilk.&#8217; In the article there is
a complaint that our majority are miserably unacquainted
with Scottish ecclesiastical history; and there is special
mention made of Mr. Cunningham as an individual not
only ignorant of facts, but as even incapable of being made
to feel their force. In the <i>Annual</i>, as if Mr. Cumming
wished to exemplify, there is a passage in Scottish ecclesiastical
history, of which we are certain Mr. Cunningham
not only knows nothing, but which we are sure he will prove
too obstinate to credit or comprehend. &#8216;The celebrated
Mr. Cameron,&#8217; says the minister of the Scottish Church,
London, &#8216;was left on Drumclog a mangled corpse.&#8217; Fine
thing to be minutely acquainted with ecclesiastical history!
We illiterate non-intrusionists hold, and we are afraid Mr.
Cunningham among the rest, that the celebrated Cameron
was killed, not at the skirmish of Drumclog, but at the
skirmish of Airdmoss, which did not take place until about a
twelvemonth after; but this must result surely from our ignorance.
Has the Rev. Mr. Cumming no intention of settling
our disputes, by giving us a new history of the Church?</p>
<p>That portion of the internal evidence in the article before
us which depends on style and manner, seems very conclusive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
indeed. Take some of the avowed sublimities of the
Rev. Mr. Cumming. No man stands more beautifully on
tiptoe when he sets himself to catch a fine thought. In
describing an attached congregation, &#8216;The hearer&#8217;s prayers
rose to heaven,&#8217; he says, &#8216;and returned in the shape of
broad impenetrable bucklers around the venerable man.
A thousand broadswords leapt in a thousand scabbards, as
if the electric eloquence of the minister found in them conductors
and depositories.&#8217;</p>
<p>Poetry such as this is still somewhat rare; but mark the
kindred beauties of the writer in <i>Fraser</i>. Around such men
as Mr. Tait, Dr. M&#8217;Leod, and Dr. Muir, &#8216;must crystallize
the piety and the hopes of the Scottish Church.&#8217; What a
superb figure! Only think of the Rev. Dr. Muir as of a
thread in a piece of sugar candy, and the piety of the
Dean of Faculty and Mr. Penney, joined to that of some
four or five hundred respectable ladies of both sexes besides,
all sticking out around him in cubes, hexagons, and prisms,
like cleft almonds in a bishop-cake. Hardly inferior in the
figurative is the passage which follows: &#8216;The Doctor (Dr.
Chalmers) rides on at a rickety trot,&ndash;&ndash;Messrs. Cunningham,
Begg, and Candlish by turns whipping up the wornout
Rosenante, and making the rider believe that windmills are
Church principles, and the echoes of their thunder solid
argument. A ditch will come; and when the first effects
of the fall are over, the dumbfounded Professor will awake
to the deception, and smite the minnows of vetoism hip
and thigh.&#8217; The writer of this passage is unquestionably an
ingenious man, but he could surely have made a little more
of the last figure. A dissertation on the hips and thighs of
minnows might be made to reflect new honour on even the
genius of the Rev. Mr. Cumming.</p>
<p>It is mainly, however, from the Episcopalian tone of the
article that we derive our evidence. The writer seems to
hold, with Charles II., that Presbyterianism is no fit religion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
for a gentleman. True, the Moderates were genteel men, of
polish and propriety, such as Mr. Jaffray of Dunbar, who
never at synod or presbytery did or said anything that was
not strictly polite; but then the Moderates had but little
of Presbyterianism in their religion, and perhaps, notwithstanding
their &#8216;quiet, amiable, and courteous demeanour,&#8217;
little of religion itself. It is to quite a different class that
the hope of the writer turns. He states that &#8216;melancholy
facts and strong arguments against the practical working
of Presbytery is at this moment impressing itself in Scotland
on every unprejudiced spectator;&#8217; that there is a party,
however, &#8216;with whom the ministerial office is a sacred investiture,
transmitted by succession through pastor to pastor,
and from age to age,&ndash;&ndash;men inducted to their respective
parishes, not because their flocks like or dislike them, but
because the superintending authorities, after the exercise
of solemn, minute, and patient investigation, have determined
that this or that pastor is the fittest and best for this
or that parish;&#8217; that there exist in this noble party &#8216;the
germs of a possible unity with the southern Church;&#8217; and
that there is doubtless a time coming when the body of our
Establishment, &#8216;sick of slavery under the name of freedom,
and of sheer Popery under Presbyterian colours, shall send
up three of their best men to London for consecration, and
Episcopacy shall again become the adoption of Scotland.&#8217;
Rarely has the imagination of the poet conjured up a vision
of greater splendour. The minister of the Scotch Church,
London, may die Archbishop of St. Andrews. And such
an archbishop! We are told in the article that &#8216;the channel
along which ministerial orders are to be transmitted is
the pastors of the Church, whether they meet together in
the presbytery, or are compressed and consolidated in the
bishop.&#8217; But is not this understating the case on the Episcopal
side? What would not Scotland gain if she could
compress and consolidate a simple presbytery, such as that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
of Edinburgh&ndash;&ndash;its Chalmers and its Gordon, its Candlish
and its Cunningham, its Guthrie, its Brown, its Bennie, its
Begg&ndash;&ndash;in short, all its numerous members&ndash;&ndash;into one great
Bishop John Cumming, late of the Scotch Church, London!
The man who converts twenty-one shillings into a gold
guinea gains nothing by the process; but the case would
be essentially different here, for not only would there be
a great good accomplished, but also a great evil removed.
As for Dr. Chalmers, it is &#8216;painfully evident,&#8217; says the writer
of the article, &#8216;that he regards only three things additional
to a &#8220;supernal influence&#8221; as requisite to constitute any
one a minister&ndash;&ndash;a knowledge of Christianity, and endowment,
and a parish;&#8217; and as for the rest of the gentlemen
named, they are just preparing to do, in an &#8216;ecclesiastical
way in Edinburgh, what Robespierre, Marat, and others did
in a corporal way in the Convention of 1793.&#8217;</p>
<p>Hogarth quarrelled with Churchill, and drew him as a
bear in canonicals. Had he lived to quarrel with the Rev.
John Cumming, he would in all probability have drawn him
as a puppy in gown and band; and no one who knows
aught of the painter can doubt that he would have strikingly
preserved the likeness. As for ourselves, we merely
indulge in a piece of conjectural criticism. The other parts
of the article are cast very much into the ordinary type of
that side of the controversy to which it belongs: there is
rather more than the usual amount of misrepresentation,
inconsistency, and abuse, with here and there a peculiarity
of statement. Patrons are described as the &#8216;trustees of
the supreme magistrate, beautifully and devoutly appointed
to submit the presentee to the presbytery.&#8217; Lord Aberdeen&#8217;s
bill is eulogized as suited to &#8216;confer a greater boon
on the laity of Scotland than was ever conferred on them
by the General Assembly.&#8217; The seven clergymen of Strathbogie
are praised for &#8216;having rendered unto God the things
that are God&#8217;s,&#8217; &#8216;their enemies being judges.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>The minority of the Church contains, it is stated, its best
men, and its most diligent ministers. As for the majority,
they have been possessed by a spirit of &#8216;deep delusion;&#8217;
their only idea of a &#8216;clergyman is a preaching machine,
that makes a prodigious vociferation, and pleases the herd.&#8217;
They are destined to become&#8217; contemptible and base;&#8217; their
attitude is an &#8216;unrighteous attitude;&#8217; they are aiming, &#8216;like
Popish priests,&#8217; at &#8216;supremacy&#8217; and a deadly despotism,
through the sides of the people; they are &#8216;suicidally
divesting themselves of their power as clergymen, by surrendering
to the people essentially Episcopal functions;&#8217;
they are &#8216;wild men,&#8217; and offenders against the &#8216;divine
headship;&#8217; and the writer holds, therefore, that if the Establishment
is to be maintained in Scotland, they must be
crushed, and that soon, by the strong arm of the law.
We need make no further remarks on the subject. To
employ one of the writer&#8217;s own illustrations, the history of
Robespierre powerfully demonstrates that great vanity, great
weakness, and great cruelty, may all find room together in
one little mind.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;" >TO THE EDITOR OF THE WITNESS.</p>
<p><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Sir</span>,&ndash;&ndash;Upon hearing read aloud your remarks<a name='FNanchor_0019' id='FNanchor_0019'></a><a href='#Footnote_0019' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> in the <i>Witness</i>
of Saturday the 28th ultimo, upon the danger of investing
the mere building in which we meet for public worship with
a character of sanctity, an English gentleman asked, &#8216;How
does the writer of that article reconcile with his views our
Saviour&#8217;s conduct, described by St. John, ii. 14-17, and by
each of the other evangelists?&#8217;</p>
<p>Though quite disposed to agree with the purport of your
remarks, and fully aware that the tendency of the opinions
openly promulgated by a large section of the clergy of the
Church of England is to give &#8216;the Church&#8217; the place which
should be occupied by a living and active faith in our Saviour,
I found it difficult to meet this gentleman&#8217;s objections, and
only reminded him that you made a special exception in
the case of the Jewish temple. Brought up from childhood,
as Englishmen are, with almost superstitious reverence for
the buildings &#8216;consecrated&#8217; and set apart for religious uses,
it is difficult to meet objections founded on such strong
prejudices as were evident in this case.</p>
<p>If any arguments suggest themselves to you, to show that
the passage above referred to cannot be fairly employed in
the defence of the Church of England tenets, in favour of
consecrating churches, and of reverence amounting almost
to the worship of external objects devoted to religious purposes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
you will oblige me by stating them.&ndash;&ndash;I remain, Sir,
Your obedient servant,</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The passage of Scripture referred to by the &#8216;English
Gentleman&#8217; here as scarcely reconcilable with the views
promulgated in the <i>Witness</i> of the 28th ult. runs as follows:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;And
Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and found in the
temple those that sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the
changers of money, sitting; and when He had made a scourge
of small cords, He drove them all out of the temple, and
the sheep and the oxen; and poured out the changers&#8217;
money, and overthrew the tables; and said unto them that
sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father&#8217;s
house a house of merchandise.&#8217;</p>
<p>It will perhaps be remembered by our readers, that in
referring to the Scotch estimate of the sacredness of ecclesiastical
edifices, we employed words to the following effect:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;We
(the Scotch people) have been taught that the world,
since it began, saw but two truly holy edifices; and that
these, the Tabernacle and the <i>Temple</i>, were as direct revelations
from God as the Scriptures themselves, and were as
certain embodiments of His will, though they spoke in the
obscure language of type and symbol.&#8217; Now the passage
of Scripture here cited is in harmonious accordance with
this view. It was from one of these truly holy edifices that
our Saviour drove the sheep and oxen, and indignantly
expelled the money-changers. Without, however, begging
the whole question at issue&ndash;&ndash;without taking for granted the
very point to be proven, <i>i.e.</i> the intrinsic holiness of Christian
places of worship&ndash;&ndash;the text has no bearing whatever on the
view taken by the &#8216;English Gentleman.&#8217; If buildings such
as York Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, and St. Paul&#8217;s, be
holy in the sense in which the temple was holy, then the
passage as certainly applies to them as it applied, in the
times of our Saviour, to the sacred edifice which was so remarkable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
a revelation of Himself. But where is the evidence
of an intrinsic holiness in these buildings? Where is the
proof that the rite of consecration is a rite according to the
mind of God? Where is the probability even that it is other
than a piece of mere will-worship, originated in the dark
ages; or that it confers one whit more sanctity on the edifice
which it professes to render sacred, than the breaking a
bottle of wine on the ship&#8217;s stem, when she is starting off
the slips, confers sanctity on the ship? Stands it on any
surer ground than the baptism of bells, the sacrifice of the
mass, or the five spurious sacraments? If it be a New
Testament institution, it must possess New Testament
authority. Where is that authority?</p>
<p>Can it be possible, however, that the shrewd English
really differ from us in our estimate? We think we have
good grounds for holding they do not. On a late occasion
we enjoyed the pleasure of visiting not only York Cathedral,
but Westminster Abbey and St. Paul&#8217;s, and saw quite enough
to make even the least mistrustful suspect that the professed
Episcopalian belief in the sacredness of ecclesiastical edifices
is but sheer make-belief after all. The &#8216;English Gentleman&#8217;
refers to the example of our Saviour in thrusting forth the
money-changers from the temple, as a sort of proof that
ecclesiastical edifices are holy; and we show that it merely
proves the temple to have been holy. The passage has,
however, a direct bearing on a somewhat different point:
it constitutes a test by which to try the reality of this
ostensible belief of English Episcopalians in the sacredness
of their churches and cathedrals. If the English, especially
English Churchmen, act with regard to their ecclesiastical
buildings in the way our Saviour acted with regard to the
temple, then it is but fair to hold that their belief in their
sacredness is real. But if, on the contrary, we find them
acting, not as our Saviour acted, but as the money-changers
or the cattle-sellers acted, then is it equally fair to conclude
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
that their belief in their sacredness is not a real belief, but
a piece of mere pretence. In the north transept of York
Minster there may be seen a table like a tomb of black
Purbec marble, supported by an iron trellis, and bearing
atop the effigy of a wasted corpse wrapped in a winding-sheet.
&#8216;This monument,&#8217; says a little work descriptive of
the edifice, &#8216;was erected to the memory of John Haxby,
formerly treasurer to the church, who died in 1424; and in
compliance with stipulations in some of the ancient church
deeds and settlements, occasional payments of money are
made on this tomb to the present day.&#8217; Here, at least, is
one money-changing table introduced into the consecrated
area, and this not irregularly or surreptitiously, like the
money-changing tables which of old profaned the temple,
but through the deliberately formed stipulations of ecclesiastical
deeds and settlements. The state of things in St.
Paul&#8217;s and Westminster, however, throws the money-table
of York Minster far into the shade. The holinesses of St.
Paul&#8217;s we found converted into a twopenny, and those of
Westminster into a sixpenny show. For the small sum of
twopence one may be admitted, at an English provincial
fair, to see the old puppet exhibition of Punch and Judy,
and of Solomon in all his glory; and for the small sum of
twopence were we admitted, in like manner, to see St.
Paul&#8217;s, to see choir, communion-table, and grand altar, and
everything else of peculiar sacredness within the edifice.
The holinesses of Westminster cost thrice as much, but were
a good bargain notwithstanding. Would English Churchmen
permit, far less originate and insist in doggedly maintaining,
so palpable a profanation, did they really believe
their cathedrals to be holy? The debased Jewish priesthood
of the times of our Saviour suffered the money-changers to
traffic unchallenged within the temple; but they did not
convert the temple itself into a twopenny show: they did
not make halfpence by exhibiting the table of shew-bread,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
the altar of incense, and the golden candlestick, nor lift up
corners of the veil at the rate of a penny a peep. It is
worse than nonsense to hold that a belief in the sacredness
of ecclesiastical buildings can co-exist with clerical practices
of the kind we describe: the thing is a too palpable improbability;
the text quoted by the Englishman is conclusive
on the point. Would any man in his senses now hold that
the old Jewish priests really believed their temple to be
holy, had they done, what they had decency enough not
to do&ndash;&ndash;converted it into a raree-show? And are we not
justified in applying to English Churchmen the rule which
would be at once applied to Jewish priests? The Presbyterians
of Scotland do not deem their ecclesiastical edifices
holy, but there are certain natural associations that throw
a degree of solemnity over places in which men assemble to
worship God; and in order that these may not be outraged,
they never convert their churches into twopenny show-boxes.
Practically, at least, the Scotch respect for decency
goes a vast deal further than the English regard for what
they profess, very insincerely it would seem, to hold sacred.</p>
<p>We have said there is quite as little New Testament
authority for consecrating a place of worship as for baptizing
a bell; and if in the wrong, can of course be easily set
right. If the authority exists, it can be no difficult matter
to produce it. We would fain ask the reader to remark the
striking difference which obtains between the Mosaic and
the New Testament dispensations in all that regards the
materialisms of their respective places of worship. We find
in the Pentateuch chapter after chapter occupied with the
mechanism of the tabernacle. The pattern given in the
mount is as minutely described as any portion of the ceremonial
law, and for exactly the same reason: the one as
certainly as the other was &#8216;a figure of things to come.&#8217; How
exceedingly minute, too, the description of the temple!
How very particular the narrative of its dedication! The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
prayer of Solomon, Heaven-inspired for the occasion, forms
an impressive chapter in the sacred record, that addresses
itself to all time. But when the old state of things had
passed away,&ndash;&ndash;when the material was relinquished for the
spiritual, the shadow for the substance, the type for the
antitype,&ndash;&ndash;we hear no more of places of worship to which
an intrinsic holiness attached, or of imposing rites of dedication.
Not in edifices deemed sacred was the gospel promulgated,
so long as the gospel remained pure, but in &#8216;hired
houses&#8217; and &#8216;upper rooms,&#8217; or &#8216;river-sides, where prayer was
wont to be made,&#8217; in chambers on the &#8216;third loft,&#8217; often in
the streets, often in the market-place, in the fields and by
solitary waysides, on shipboard and by the sea-shore, &#8216;in
the midst of Mars Hill&#8217; at Athens, and, when persecution
began to darken, amid the deep gloom of the sepulchral
caverns of Rome. The time had evidently come, referred
to by the Saviour, when neither in the temple at Jerusalem,
nor on the mountain deemed sacred by the Samaritans, was
the Father to be worshipped; but all over the world, &#8216;in
spirit and in truth.&#8217; Until Christianity had become corrupt,
we do not hear even of ornate churches, far less of Christian
altars, of an order of Christian priests, of the will-worship
of consecration, or of the presumed holiness of insensate
matter,&ndash;&ndash;all unauthorized additions of man&#8217;s making to a
religion fast sinking at the time under a load of human
inventions,&ndash;&ndash;additions which were in no degree the more
sacred, because filched, amid the darkness of superstition
and error, from the abrogated Mosaic dispensation. The
following is, we believe, the first notice of <i>fine</i> Christian
churches which occurs in history;&ndash;&ndash;we quote from the ecclesiastical
work of Dr. Welsh, and deem the passage a significant
one:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;From the beginning of the reign of Gallienus
till the nineteenth year of Diocletian,&#8217; says the historian,
&#8216;the external tranquillity of the Church suffered no general
interruption. The Christians, with partial exceptions, were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
allowed the free exercise of their religion. Under Diocletian
open profession of the new faith was made even in the imperial
household; nor did it prove a barrier to the highest honours
and employments. In this state of affairs the condition
of the Church seemed in the highest degree prosperous.
Converts were multiplied throughout all the provinces of
the empire; and the ancient churches proving insufficient
for the accommodation of the increasing multitudes of worshippers,
<i>splendid edifices were erected in every city</i>, which were
filled with crowded congregations. But with this outward
appearance of success, the purity of faith and worship became
gradually corrupted; and, still more, the vital spirit of
religion suffered a melancholy decline. Pride and ambition,
emulation and strifes, hypocrisy and formality among
the clergy, and superstitions and factions among the people,
brought reproach on the Christian cause. In these circumstances
the judgments of the Lord were manifested, and the
Church was visited with the severest persecution to which
it ever yet had been subjected.&#8217;</p>
<p>There are few more valuable chapters in Locke than the
one in which he traces some of the gravest errors that infest
human life to a false association of ideas. But of all his
illustrations, employed to exhibit in the true light this copious
source of error, there is not one half so striking as that furnished
by the false association which connects the holiness
that can alone attach to the living and the immortal, with
earth, mortar, and stone, pieces of mouldering serge, and
bits of rotten wood. Nearly one half of the errors with
which Popery has darkened and overlaid the religion of the
Cross, have originated in this particular species of false
association. The superstition of pilgrimages, with all its
long catalogue of crime and suffering, inclusive of bloody
wars, protracted for ages,&ndash;&ndash;-</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>the idolatry of relics, so strangely revived on the Continent
in our own times,&ndash;&ndash;the allegorical will-worship embodied in
stone and lime, which Puseyism is at present so busy in
introducing into the Church of England, and which renders
every ecclesiastical building a sort of apocryphal temple,
full, like the apocryphal books, of all manner of error and
nonsense,&ndash;&ndash;a thousand other absurdities and heterodoxies
besides,&ndash;&ndash;have all originated in this cause. True, such
association is most natural to man, and, when of a purely
secular character, harmless; nay, there are cases in which
it may be even laudably indulged. &#8216;When I find Tully
confessing of himself,&#8217; says Johnson, &#8216;that he could not
forbear at Athens to visit the walks and houses which the
old philosophers had frequented or inhabited, and recollect
the reverence which every nation, civil and barbarous, has
paid to the ground where merit has been buried, I am
afraid to declare against the general voice of mankind, and
am inclined to believe that this regard which we involuntarily
pay to the meanest relique of a man great and illustrious,
is intended as an incitement to labour, and an
encouragement to expect the same renown if it be sought
by the same virtues.&#8217; We find nearly the same sentiment
eloquently expounded in the Doctor&#8217;s famous passage on
Iona. But there exists a grand distinction between natural
feelings proper in their own place, and natural feelings
permitted to enter the religious field, and vitiate the integrity
of revelation. It is from the natural alone in such
cases that danger is to be apprehended; seeing that what
is not according to the mental constitution of man, is of
necessity at once unproductive and shortlived. Let due
weight be given to the associative feeling, in its proper
sphere,&ndash;&ndash;let it dispose us to invest with a quiet decency
our places of worship,&ndash;&ndash;let us, at all events, not convert
them into secular counting-rooms or twopenny show-boxes;
but let us also remember that natural association is not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
divine truth&ndash;&ndash;that there attaches no holiness to slated roofs
or stone walls&ndash;&ndash;that under the New Testament dispensation
men do not worship in temples, which, like the altar
of old, sanctified the gift, but in mere places of shelter, that
confer no sacredness on their services; and that the &#8216;hour
has come, and now is, when they that worship the Father
must worship Him in spirit and in truth.&#8217;</p>

<h2>THE LATE REV. ALEXANDER STEWART.</h2>
</div>
<p>Our last conveyed to our readers the mournful intelligence
of the illness and death of the Rev. Alexander Stewart of
Cromarty,&ndash;&ndash;a man less known, perhaps, than any other of
nearly equal calibre, or of a resembling exquisitiveness of
mental faculty, which his country has ever produced, but
whose sudden removal has, we find, created an impression
far beyond the circle of even his occasional hearers, that
the spirit which has passed away was one of the high cast
which nature rarely produces, and that the consequent
blank created in the existing phalanx of intellect is one
which cannot be filled up. Comparatively little as the
deceased was known beyond his own immediate walk of
duty or circle of acquaintanceship, it is yet felt by thousands,
of whom the greater part knew of him merely at
second-hand by the abiding impression which he had left
on the minds of the others, that, according to the poet,</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8216;</span>A mighty spirit is eclipsed; a power<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Hath passed from day to darkness, to whose hour</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Of light no likeness is bequeathed&ndash;&ndash;no name.&#8217;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>The subject is one with which we can scarce trust ourselves.
There are no writings to which we can appeal,
for Mr. Stewart has left none, or at least none suited to
convey an adequate impression of his powers; and yet of
nothing are we more thoroughly convinced, than that the
originality and vigour of his thinking, and the singular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
vividness and force of his illustrations, added to a command
of the principles of analogical reasoning, which even
a Butler might have envied, entitled him to rank with the
ablest and most extraordinary men of the age. Coleridge
was not more thoroughly original, nor could he impart to
his pictures more vividness of colouring, or more decided
strength of outline. In glancing over our limited stock of
idea, to note how we have come by it, we find that to
two Scotchmen of the present century we stand more
largely indebted than to any of their contemporaries, either
at home or abroad. More of their thinking has got into
our mind than that of any of the others; and their images
and illustrations recur to us more frequently. And one of
these is Thomas Chalmers; the other, Alexander Stewart.</p>
<p>There is an order of intellect decidedly original in its
cast, and of considerable power, to whom notwithstanding
originality is dangerous. Goldsmith, when he first entered
on his literary career, found that all the good things on the
side of truth had already been said; and that <i>his</i> good
things, if he really desired to produce any, would require
all to be said on the side of paradox and error. &#8216;When I
was a young man,&#8217; he states, in a passage which Johnson
censured him for afterwards expunging, &#8216;being anxious to
distinguish myself, I was perpetually starting new propositions.
But I soon gave this over, for I found that generally
what was new was false.&#8217; Poor Edward Irving formed a
melancholy illustration of this species of originality. His
stock of striking things on the side of truth was soon expended;
notoriety had meanwhile become as essential to
his comfort as ardent spirits to that of the dram-drinker,
or his pernicious drug to that of the inveterate opium-eater;
and so, to procure the supply of the unwholesome pabulum,
without which he could not continue to exist, he launched
into a perilous ocean of heterodoxy and extravagance, and
made shipwreck of his faith. His originality formed but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
the crooked wanderings of a journeyer who had forsaken
the right way, and lost himself in the mazes of a doleful
wilderness. Not such the originality of the higher order of
minds; not such, for instance, the originality of a Newton,
of whom it has been well said by a distinguished French
critic, that &#8216;what province of thought soever he undertook,
he was sure to change the ideas and opinions received by
the rest of men.&#8217; One of the most striking characteristics of
Mr. Stewart&#8217;s originality was the solidity of the truths which
it always evolved. His was not the ability of opening up
new vistas in which all was unfamiliar, simply because the
direction in which they led was one in which men&#8217;s thought
had no occasion to travel, and no business to perform. It
was, on the contrary, the greatly higher ability of enlarging,
widening, and lengthening the avenues long before opened
upon important truths, and, in consequence, enabling men
to see new and unwonted objects in old, familiar directions.
That in which he excelled all men we ever knew, was the
analogical faculty&ndash;&ndash;the power of detecting and demonstrating
occult resemblances. He could read off as if by
intuition&ndash;&ndash;not by snatches and fragments, but as a consecutive
whole&ndash;&ndash;that older revelation of type and symbol which
God first gave to man; and when privileged to listen to
him, we have recognised, in the evident integrity of the
reading, and the profound and consistent wisdom of what
the record conveyed, a demonstration of the divinity of its
origin, not less powerful and convincing than that to be
found in any department of the Christian evidences yet
opened up. Compared with even the higher names in this
department, we have felt under his ministry as if, when
admitted to the company of some party of modern <i>savans</i>
employed in deciphering a hieroglyphic-covered obelisk of
the desert, and here successful in discovering the meaning
of an insulated sign, and there of a detached symbol, we
had been suddenly joined by some sage of the olden time,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
to whom the mysterious inscription was but a piece of
common language written in a familiar alphabet, and who
could read off fluently and as a whole what the others
could but darkly and painfully guess at in detached and
broken parts.</p>
<p>To this singular power of tracing analogies there was
added in Mr. Stewart an ability of originating the most
vivid illustrations. In some instances a single stroke produced
a figure that swept across the subject-matter of his
discourse like the image of a lantern on a wall; in others,
he dwelt upon the picture produced, finishing it with stroke
after stroke, until it filled the whole imagination, and sank
deep into the memory. We remember hearing him preach
on one occasion on the return of the Jews, as a people, to
Him whom they had rejected, and the effect which their
sudden conversion could not fail to have on the unbelieving
and Gentile world. Suddenly his language, from its high
level of eloquent simplicity, became at once that of metaphor:
&#8216;When <i>Joseph</i>,&#8217; he said, &#8216;shall reveal himself to <i>his
brethren</i>, the <i>whole house of Pharaoh</i> shall <i>hear the weeping</i>.&#8217;
Could there be an allusion of more classical beauty, or
more finely charged with typical truth? And yet such was
one of the common and briefer exercises of the illustrative
faculty in this gifted man. On another occasion we heard
him dwell on that vast profundity characteristic of the
scriptural representations of God, which ever deepens and
broadens the longer and the more thoroughly it is explored,
until at length the student&ndash;&ndash;struck at first by its expansiveness,
but conceiving of it as if it were a mere <i>measured</i>
expansiveness&ndash;&ndash;finds that it partakes of the unlimited infinity
of the divine nature itself. Naturally and simply, as
if growing out of the subject, like a green berry-covered
misletoe on the mossy trunk of a reverend oak, there
sprang up one of his more lengthened illustrations. A
child bred up in the interior of the country has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
brought for the first time to the sea-shore, and carried out
to the middle of one of the noble friths that indent so deeply
our line of coast; and on his return he informs his father,
with all a child&#8217;s eagerness, of the wonderful expansiveness
of the <i>ocean</i> which he has seen. He went out, he tells, far
amid the great waves and the rushing tides, till at length the
huge hills seemed diminished into mere hummocks, and the
wide land itself appeared along the waters but as a slim strip
of blue. And then when in mid-sea the sailors heaved the
lead; and it went down, and down, and down, and the long
line slipped swiftly away over the boat-edge coil after coil, till,
ere the plummet rested on the ouse below, all was well-nigh
expended. And was it not the <i>great</i> sea, asks the boy, that
was so vastly broad, and so profoundly deep? Ah! my
child, exclaims the father, you have not yet seen aught of
its greatness,&ndash;&ndash;you have sailed over merely one of its little
arms. Had it been out into the wide ocean that the seamen
had carried you, you would have <i>seen</i> no shore, and
you would have <i>found</i> no bottom. In one rare quality of
the orator, Mr. Stewart stood alone among his contemporaries.
Pope refers, in one of his satires, to a strange
power of creating love and admiration by just &#8216;touching the
brink of all we hate;&#8217; and Burke, in some of his nobler
passages, happily exemplifies the thing. He intensified the
effect of his burning eloquence by the employment of figures
so homely, nay, almost so repulsive in themselves, that a
man of lower powers who ventured their use would find
them efficient merely in lowering his subject and ruining his
cause. We may refer, in illustration, to Burke&#8217;s celebrated
figure of the disembowelled bird, which occurs in his indignant
denial that the character of the revolutionary French
in aught resembled that of the English. &#8216;We have not,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;been <i>drawn</i> and <i>trussed</i>, in order that we may be
filled, <i>like stuffed birds in a museum</i>, with <i>chaff and rags</i>,
and <i>paltry blurred shreds of paper</i> about the rights of man.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
Into this perilous but singularly effective department, closed
against even superior men, Mr. Stewart could enter safely
and at will. We heard him, scarce a twelvemonth since,
deliver a discourse of singular power, on the sin-offering
of the Jewish economy, as minutely particularized by the
divine penman in Leviticus. He described the slaughtered
animal&ndash;&ndash;foul with dust and blood&ndash;&ndash;its throat gashed across&ndash;&ndash;its
entrails laid open&ndash;&ndash;and steaming in its impurity to
the sun, as it awaited the consuming fire, amid the uncleanness
of ashes outside the camp,&ndash;&ndash;a vile and horrid thing,
which no one could see without experiencing emotions of
disgust, nor touch without contracting defilement. The
picture appeared too painfully vivid, its introduction too
little in accordance with the rules of a just taste. It
seemed a thing to be covered up, not exhibited. But the
master in this difficult walk well knew what he was doing.
&#8216;And that,&#8217; he said, as if pointing to the strongly-coloured
picture he had just completed, &#8216;and that is <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>SIN</span>.&#8217; By one
stroke the intended effect was produced, and the rising
disgust and horror transferred from the revolting material
image to the great moral evil.</p>
<p>We had fondly hoped that for a man so singularly gifted,
and who had but reached the ripe maturity of middle life,
there remained important work yet to do. He seemed
peculiarly fitted, if but placed in a commanding sphere, for
ministering to some of the intellectual wants, and for withstanding
with singular efficiency some of the more perilous
tendencies, of the religious world in the present day. That
Athenian thirst for the new so generally abroad, and which
many have so unhappily satisfied with the unwholesome
and the pernicious, he could satisfy with provision at once
sound and novel. And no man of the age had more
thoroughly studied the prevailing theological errors of the
time in their first insidious approaches, or could more skilfully
indicate the exact point at which they diverge from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
the truth. But his work on earth is for ever over; and the
sense of bereavement is deepened by the reflection that,
save in the memory of a few, he has left behind him no
adequate impress of the powers of his understanding or of
the fineness of his genius. It is strange how much the
lack of a single ingredient in a man&#8217;s moral constitution&ndash;&ndash;and
that, too, an ingredient in itself of a low and vulgar
cast&ndash;&ndash;may affect one&#8217;s whole destiny. It was the grand
defect of this gifted man, that that sentiment of self-esteem,
which seems in many instances so absurd and ridiculous a
thing, and which some, in their little wisdom, would so fain
strike out from among the components of human character,
was almost wholly awanting. As the minister of an attached
provincial congregation, a sense of duty led him to study
much and deeply; and he poured forth <i>viva voce</i> his full-volumed
and many-sparkling tide of eloquent idea as freely
and richly as the nightingale, unconscious of a listener,
pours forth her melody in the shade. But he could not be
made to understand or believe, that what so impressed and
delighted the privileged few who surrounded him was
equally suited to impress and delight the many outside, or
that he was fitted to speak through the press in tones which
would compel the attention not merely of the religious, but
also of the literary world. And so his exquisitely-toned
thinking perished like the music of the bygone years, has
died with himself, or, we should perhaps rather say, has
gone with him to that better land, where all those fruits
of intellect that the human spirits of greatest calibre have
in this world produced, must form but the comparatively
meagre beginnings of infinite, never-ending acquirement.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart was one of the eminently excellent and loveable,
and his entire character of the most transparent, childlike
simplicity. The great realities of eternity were never
far distant from his thoughts. Endowed with powers of
humour at least equal to his other faculties, and a sense of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
the ludicrous singularly nice, he has often reminded us in
his genial moments, when indulging most freely, of a happy
child at play in the presence of its father. Never was there
an equal amount of wit more harmlessly indulged, or from
which one could pass more directly or with less distraction
to the contemplation of the matters which pertain to eternity.
And no one could be long in his company without having
his thoughts turned towards that unseen world to which he
has now passed, or without receiving emphatic testimony
regarding that Divine Person who is the wisdom and the
power of God.</p>
<p>We have seen it stated that Mr. Stewart &#8216;was slow to
join the non-intrusion party, and to acquiesce in the necessity
of the secession.&#8217; On this point we are qualified to
speak. No one enjoyed more of his society during the
first beginnings of the controversy, or was more largely
honoured with his confidence, than the writer of these
remarks; and the one point of difference between Mr.
Stewart and him in their discussions in those days was,
that while the writer was sanguine enough to anticipate a
successful termination to the Church&#8217;s struggle, <i>his</i> soberer
anticipations were of a character which the Disruption in
1843 entirely verified. But with the actual result full in
view, he was yet the first man in his parish&ndash;&ndash;we believe,
in his presbytery also&ndash;&ndash;to take his stand, modestly and
unassumingly as became his character, but with a firmness
which never once swerved or wavered. Nay, long ere the
struggle began, founding on data with which we pretend
not to be acquainted, he declared his conviction to not a
few of his parishioners, that of the Establishment, as then
constituted, he was to be the last minister in that parish.
We know nothing, we repeat, of the data on which he
founded; but he himself held that the conclusion was
fairly deducible from those sacred oracles which no man
more profoundly studied or more thoroughly knew. Alas!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
what can it betoken our Church, that we should thus see
such men, at once its strength and its ornament, so fast
falling around us, like commanding officers picked down at
the beginning of a battle, and that so few of resembling
character, and none of at least equal power, should be
rising to occupy the places made desolate by their fall!</p>

<h2>THE CALOTYPE.</h2>
</div>
<p>There are some two or three slight advantages which real
merit has, that fictitious merit has not; among the rest,
an especial advantage, which, we think, should recommend
it to at least the quieter members of society&ndash;&ndash;the advantage
of being unobtrusive and modest. It presses itself much
less on public notice than its vagabond antagonist, and
makes much less noise; it walks, for a time at least, as if
slippered in felt, and leaves the lieges quite at freedom to
take notice of it or no, as they may feel inclined. It is
content, in its infancy, to thrive in silence. It does not
squall in the nursery, to the disturbance of the whole
house, like &#8216;the major roaring for his porridge.&#8217; What, for
instance, could be quieter or more modest, in its first
stages, than the invention of James Watt? what more
obtrusive or noisy, on the contrary, than the invention of
Mr. Henson? And we have illustrations of the same truth
in our Scottish metropolis at the present moment, that
seem in no degree less striking. Phreno-mesmerism and
the calotype have been introduced to the Edinburgh
public about much the same time; but how very differently
have they fared hitherto! A real invention, which bids
fair to produce some of the greatest revolutions in the fine
arts of which they have ever been the subject, has as yet
attracted comparatively little notice; an invention which
serves but to demonstrate that the present age, with all its
boasted enlightenment, may yet not be very unfitted for the
reception of superstitions the most irrational and gross, is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
largely occupying the attention of the community, and filling
column after column in our public prints. We shall venture
to take up the quieter invention of the two as the genuine
one,&ndash;&ndash;as the invention which will occupy most space a
century hence,&ndash;&ndash;and direct the attention of our readers to
some of the more striking phenomena which it illustrates,
and some of the purposes which it may be yet made to
subserve. There are few lovers of art who have looked
on the figures or landscapes of a camera obscura without
forming the wish that, among the hidden secrets of matter,
some means might be discovered for fixing and rendering
them permanent. If nature could be made her own limner,
if by some magic art the reflection could be fixed upon the
mirror, could the picture be other than true? But the wish
must have seemed an idle one,&ndash;&ndash;a wish of nearly the same
cast as those which all remember to have formed at one
happy period of life, in connection with the famous cap
and purse of the fairy tale. Could aught seem less probable
than that the forms of the external world should be
made to convert the pencils of light which they emit into
real <i>bona fide</i> pencils, and commence taking their own
likenesses? Improbable as the thing may have seemed,
however, there were powers in nature of potency enough
to effect it, and the newly discovered art of the photographer
is simply the art of employing these. The figures
and landscapes of the camera obscura can now be fixed
and rendered permanent,&ndash;&ndash;not yet in all their various
shades of colour, but in a style scarce less striking, and
to which the limner, as if by anticipation, has already had
recourse. The connoisseur unacquainted with the results
of the recent discovery, would decide, if shown a set of
photographic impressions, that he had before him the
carefully finished drawings in sepia of some great master.
The stronger lights, as in sketches done in this colour,
present merely the white ground of the paper; a tinge of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
soft warm brown indicates the lights of lower tone; a
deeper and still deeper tinge succeeds, shading by scarce
perceptible degrees through all the various gradations,
until the darker shades concentrate into an opaque and
dingy umber, that almost rivals black in its intensity. We
have at the present moment before us&ndash;&ndash;and very wonderful
things they certainly are&ndash;&ndash;drawings on which a human
pencil was never employed. They are strangely suggestive
of the capabilities of the art. Here, for instance, is a
scene in George Street,&ndash;&ndash;part of the pavement; and a
line of buildings, from the stately erection at the corner of
Hanover Street, with its proud Corinthian columns and
rich cornice, to Melville&#8217;s Monument and the houses
which form the eastern side of St. Andrew Square. St.
Andrew&#8217;s Church rises in the middle distance. The drawing
is truth itself; but there are cases in which mere truth
might be no great merit: were the truth restricted here to
the proportions of the architecture, there could be nothing
gained by surveying the transcript, that could not be gained
by surveying the originals. In this little brown drawing,
however, the truth is truth according to the rules of lineal
perspective, unerringly deduced; and from a set of similar
drawings, this art of perspective, so important to the artist&ndash;&ndash;which
has been so variously taught, and in which so
many masters have failed&ndash;&ndash;could be more surely acquired
than by any other means. Of all the many treatises yet
written on the subject, one of the best was produced by
the celebrated Ferguson the astronomer, the sole fruit
derived to the fine arts by his twenty years&#8217; application to
painting. There are, however, some of his rules arbitrary
in their application, and the propriety of which he has not
even attempted to demonstrate. Here, for the first time,
on this square of paper, have we the data on which perspective
may be rendered a certain science. We have
but to apply our compasses and rules in order to discover
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
the proportions in which, according to their distances,
objects diminish. Mark these columns, for instance. One
line prolonged in the line of their architrave, and another
line prolonged in the line of their bases, bisect one another
in the point of sight fixed in the distant horizon; and in this
one important point we find all the other parallel lines of
the building converging. The fact, though unknown to the
ancients, has been long familiar to the artists of comparatively
modern times,&ndash;&ndash;so familiar, indeed, that it forms one
of the first lessons of the drawing-master. The rule is a fixed
one; but there is another rule equally important, not yet fixed,&ndash;&ndash;that
rule of proportion by which to determine the breadth
which a certain extent of frontage between these converging
lines should occupy. The principle on which the horizontal
lines converge is already known, but the principle on which
the vertical lines cut these at certain determinate distances
is not yet known. It is easy taking the <i>latitudes</i> of the art,
if we may so speak, but its <i>longitudes</i> are still to discover.
At length, however, have we the lines of discovery indicated:
in the architectural drawings of the calotype the perspective
is that of nature itself; and to arrive at just conclusions, we
have but to measure and compare, and ascertain proportions.
One result of the discovery of the calotype will be,
we doubt not, the production of completer treatises on perspective
than have yet been given to the world. Another
very curious result will be, in all probability, a new mode
of design for the purposes of the engraver, especially for all
the illustrations of books. For a large class of works the
labours of the artist bid fair to be restricted to the composition
of <i>tableaux vivants</i>, which it will be the part of the
photographer to fix, and then transfer to the engraver. To
persons of artistical skill at a distance, the suggestion may
appear somewhat wild. Such of our readers, however, as
have seen the joint productions of Mr. Hill and Mr. Adamson
in this department, will, we are convinced, not deem it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
wild in the least. Compared with the mediocre prints of
nine-tenths of the illustrated works now issuing from the
press, these productions serve admirably to show how immense
the distance between nature and her less skilful
imitators. There is a truth, breadth, and power about
them which we find in only the highest walks of art, and
not often even in these. We have placed a head of Dr.
Chalmers taken in this way beside one of the most powerful
prints of him yet given to the public, and find from the
contrast that the latter, with all its power, is but a mere
approximation. There is a <i>skinniness</i> about the lips which
is not true to nature; the chin is not brought strongly
enough out; the shade beneath the under lip is too broad
and too flat; the nose droops, and lacks the firm-set appearance
so characteristic of the original; and while the
breadth of the forehead is exaggerated, there is scarce
justice done to its height. We decide at once in favour of
the calotype&ndash;&ndash;it is truth itself; and yet, while the design of
the print&ndash;&ndash;a mere approximation as it is&ndash;&ndash;must have cost
a man of genius much pains and study, the drawing in
brown beside it was but the work of a few seconds: the
eye of an accomplished artist determined the attitude of the
original, and the light reflected from the form and features
accomplished the rest. Were that sketch in brown to be
sent to a skilful engraver, he would render it the groundwork
of by far the most faithful print which the public has
yet seen. And how interesting to have bound up with the
writings of this distinguished divine, not a mere print in
which there might be deviations from the truth, but the
calotype drawing itself! In some future book sale, copies
of the <i>Astronomical Discourses</i> with calotype heads of the
author prefixed, may be found to bear very high prices
indeed. An autograph of Shakespeare has been sold of
late for considerably more than an hundred guineas.
What price would some early edition of his works bear,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
with his likeness in calotype fronting the title? Corporations
and colleges, nay, courts and governments, would
outbid one another in the purchase. Or what would we
not give to be permitted to look even on a copy of the
<i>Paradise Lost</i> with a calotype portrait of the poet in front&ndash;&ndash;serenely
placid in blindness and adversity, solacing himself,
with upturned though sightless eyes, amid the sublime
visions of the ideal world? How deep the interest which
would attach to a copy of Clarendon&#8217;s <i>History of the Civil
War</i>, with calotypes of all the more remarkable personages
who figured in that very remarkable time&ndash;&ndash;Charles, Cromwell,
Laud, Henderson, Hampden, Strafford, Falkland, and
Selden,&ndash;&ndash;and with these the Wallers and Miltons and
Cowleys, their contemporaries and coadjutors! The history
of the Reform Bill could still be illustrated after this
manner; so also could the history of Roman Catholic
Emancipation in Ireland, and the history of our Church
Question in Scotland. Even in this department&ndash;&ndash;the department
of historic illustrations&ndash;&ndash;we anticipate much and
interesting employment for the photographer.</p>
<p>We have two well-marked drawings before us, in which
we recognise the capabilities of the art for producing pictures
of composition. They are <i>tableaux vivants</i> transferred
by the calotype. In the one[Footnote: See <a href="#linki_1">Frontispiece</a>] a bonneted mechanic rests
over his mallet on a tombstone&ndash;&ndash;his one arm bared above
his elbow; the other wrapped up in the well-indicated shirt
folds, and resting on a piece of grotesque sculpture. There
is a powerful sun; the somewhat rigid folds in the dress of
coarse stuff are well marked; one half the face is in deep
shade, the other in strong light; the churchyard wall throws
a broad shadow behind, while in the foreground there is a
gracefully chequered breadth of intermingled dark and light
in the form of a mass of rank grass and foliage. Had an
old thin man of striking figure and features been selected,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
and some study-worn scholar introduced in front of him,
the result would have been a design ready for the engraver
when employed in illustrating the <i>Old Mortality</i> of Sir
Walter. The other drawing presents a <i>tableau vivant</i> on a
larger scale, and of a much deeper interest. It forms one
of the groups taken under the eye of Mr. Hill, as materials
for the composition of his historic picture. In the centre
Dr. Chalmers sits on the Moderator&#8217;s chair, and there are
grouped round him, as on the platform, some eighteen or
twenty of the better known members of the Church, clerical
and lay. Nothing can be more admirable than the truthfulness
and ease of the figures. Wilkie, in his representations
of a crowd, excelled in introducing heads, and hands,
and faces, and parts of faces into the interstices behind,&ndash;&ndash;one
of the greatest difficulties with which the artist can
grapple. Here, however, is the difficulty surmounted&ndash;&ndash;surmounted,
too, as if to bear testimony to the genius of
the departed&ndash;&ndash;in the style of Wilkie. We may add further,
that the great massiveness of the head of Chalmers, compared
with the many fine heads around him, is admirably
brought out in this drawing.</p>
<p>In glancing over these photographic sketches, one cannot
avoid being struck by the silent but impressive eulogium
which nature pronounces, through their agency, on the
works of the more eminent masters. There is much in
seeing nature truthfully, and in registering what are in
reality her prominent markings. Artists of a lower order
are continually falling into mere mannerisms&ndash;&ndash;peculiarities
of style that belong not to nature, but to themselves, just
because, contented with acquirement, they cease seeing
nature. In order to avoid these mannerisms, there is an
eye of fresh observation required&ndash;&ndash;that ability of continuous
attention to surrounding phenomena which only
superior men possess; and doubtless to this eye of fresh
observation, this ability of continuous attention, the masters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
owed much of their truth and their power. How very
truthfully and perseveringly some of them saw, is well
illustrated by these photographic drawings. Here, for instance,
is a portrait exactly after the manner of Raeburn.
There is the same broad freedom of touch; no nice miniature
stipplings, as if laid in by the point of a needle&ndash;&ndash;no
sharp-edged strokes: all is solid, massy, broad; more distinct
at a distance than when viewed near at hand. The
arrangement of the lights and shadows seems rather the
result of a happy haste, in which half the effect was produced
by design, half by accident, than of great labour
and care; and yet how exquisitely true the general aspect!
Every stroke tells, and serves, as in the portraits of Raeburn,
to do more than relieve the features: it serves also
to indicate the prevailing mood and predominant power
to the mind. And here is another portrait, quiet, deeply-toned,
gentlemanly,&ndash;&ndash;a transcript apparently of one of the
more characteristic portraits of Sir Thomas Lawrence.
Perhaps, however, of all our British artists, the artist
whose published works most nearly resemble a set of
these drawings is Sir Joshua Reynolds. We have a folio
volume of engravings from his pictures before us; and
when, placing side by side with the prints the sketches
in brown, we remark the striking similarity of style that
prevails between them, we feel more strongly than at perhaps
any former period, that the friend of Johnson and of
Burke must have been a consummate master of his art.
The engraver, however, cannot have done full justice to
the originals. There is a want of depth and prominence
which the near neighbourhood of the photographic drawings
renders very apparent: the shades in the subordinate parts
of the picture are more careless and much less true; nor
have the lights the same vivid and sunshiny effect. There
is one particular kind of resemblance between the two
which strikes as remarkable, because of a kind which could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
scarce be anticipated. In the volume of prints there are
three several likenesses of the artist himself, all very admirable
as pieces of art, and all, no doubt, sufficiently like,
but yet all dissimilar in some points from each other. And
this dissimilarity in the degree which it obtains, one might
naturally deem a defect&ndash;&ndash;the result of some slight inaccuracy
in the drawing. Should not portraits of the same individual,
if all perfect likenesses of him, be all perfectly like
one another? No; not at all. A man at one moment
of time, and seen from one particular point of view, may
be very unlike himself when seen at another moment of
time, and from another point of view. We have at present
before us the photographic likenesses of four several individuals&ndash;&ndash;three
likenesses of each&ndash;&ndash;and no two in any
of the four sets are quite alike. They differ in expression,
according to the mood which prevailed in the mind of the
original at the moment in which they were imprinted upon
the paper. In some respects the physiognomy seems different;
and the features appear more or less massy in the
degree in which the lights and shadows were more or less
strong, or in which the particular angle they were taken
in brought them out in higher or lower relief.</p>
<p>We shall venture just one remark more on these very
interesting drawings. The subject is so suggestive of
thought at the present stage, that it would be no easy
matter to exhaust it; and it will, we have no doubt, be
still more suggestive of thought by and by; but we are
encroaching on our limits, and must restrain ourselves,
therefore, to the indication of just one of the trains of
thought which it has served to originate. Many of our
readers must be acquainted with Dr. Thomas Brown&#8217;s
theory of attention,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;a state of mind,&#8217; says the philosopher,
&#8216;which has been understood to imply the exercise of a
peculiar intellectual power, but which, in the case of attention
to objects of sense, appears to be nothing more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
the co-existence of desire with the perception of the object
to which we are said to attend.&#8217; He proceeds to instance
how, in a landscape in which the incurious gaze may <i>see</i>
many objects without <i>looking</i> at or knowing them, a mere
desire to know brings out into distinctness every object
in succession on which the desire fixes. &#8216;Instantly, or
almost instantly,&#8217; continues the metaphysician, &#8216;without
our consciousness of any new or peculiar state of mind
intervening in the process, the landscape becomes to our
vision altogether different. Certain parts only&ndash;&ndash;those parts
which we wished to know particularly&ndash;&ndash;are seen by us;
the remaining parts seem almost to have vanished. It is
as if everything before had been but the doubtful colouring
of enchantment, which had disappeared, and left us the
few prominent realities on which we gaze; or rather as
if some instant enchantment, obedient to our wishes, had
dissolved every reality beside, and brought closer to our
sight the few objects which we desired to see.&#8217; Now, in
the transcript of the larger <i>tableau vivant</i> before us&ndash;&ndash;that
which represents Dr. Chalmers seated among his friends
on the Moderator&#8217;s chair&ndash;&ndash;we find an exemplification sufficiently
striking of the laws on which this seemingly mysterious
power depends. They are purely structural laws, and
relate not to the mind, but to the eye,&ndash;&ndash;not to the province
of the metaphysician, but to that of the professor of optics.
The lens of the camera obscura transmits the figures to the
prepared paper, on quite the same principle on which in
vision the crystalline lens conveys them to the retina. In
the centre of the field in both cases there is much distinctness,
while all around its circumference the images are
indistinct and dim. We have but to fix the eye on some
object directly in front of us, and then attempt, without
removing it, to ascertain the forms of objects at some distance
on both sides, in order to convince ourselves that the
field of distinct vision is a very limited field indeed. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
in this transcript of the larger <i>tableau vivant</i> we find exactly
the same phenomena. The central figures come all
within the distinct field. Not so, however, the figures on
both sides. They are dim and indistinct; the shades dilute
into the lights, and the outlines are obscure. How striking
a comment on the theory of Brown! We see his mysterious
power resolved in that drawing into a simple matter
of light and shade, arranged in accordance with certain
optical laws. The clear central space in which the figures
are so distinct, corresponds to the central space in the
retina; it is the attention-point of the picture, if we may
so speak. In the eye this attention-point is brought to
bear, through a simple effort of the will, on the object
to be examined; and the rest of the process, so pleasingly,
but at the same time so darkly, described by the philosopher,
is the work of the eye itself.</p>

<h2>THE TENANT&#8217;S TRUE QUARREL.</h2>
</div>
<p>It has been remarked by Sir James Mackintosh, that there
are four great works, in four distinct departments of knowledge,
which have more visibly and extensively influenced
opinion than any other productions of the human intellect.
The first of these is the <i>Treatise on the Law of War and
Peace</i>, by Grotius. It appeared about two centuries ago;
and from that period downwards, international law became
a solid fact, which all civilised countries have recognised,
and which even the French Convention, during the Reign
of Terror, dared, in its madness, to outrage but for a
moment. The second is the <i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i>,
by Locke. It struck down, as with the blow of
a hatchet, the wretched mental philosophy of the dark ages,&ndash;&ndash;that
philosophy which Puseyism, in its work of diffusing
over the present the barbarism and ignorance of the past,
would so fain revive and restore, and which has been ever
engaged, as its proper employment, in imparting plausibility
to error and absurdity, and in furnishing apology for crime.
The third was the <i>Spirit of Laws</i>, by Montesquieu. It
placed legislation on the basis of philosophy; and straightway
law began to spring up among the nations out of a new
soil. The fourth and last great work&ndash;&ndash;<i>An Inquiry into the
Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i>, by Adam Smith&ndash;&ndash;was
by far the most influential of them all. &#8216;It is,&#8217; says Sir
James, &#8216;perhaps the only book which produced an immediate,
general, and irrevocable change in some of the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
important parts of the legislation of all civilised states.
Touching those matters which may be numbered, and
measured, and weighed, it bore visible and palpable fruit.
In a few years it began to alter laws and treaties, and has
made its way throughout the convulsions of revolution and
conquest to a due ascendant over the minds of men, with
far less than the average obstructions of prejudice and
clamour, which check the channels through which truth
flows into practice.&#8217;</p>
<p>And yet, though many of the seeds which this great work
served to scatter sprung up thus rapidly, and produced
luxuriant crops, there were others, not less instinct with the
vital principles, of which the germination has been slow.
The nurseryman expects, in sowing beds of the stone-fruit-bearing
trees, such as the plum or the hawthorn, to see the
plants spring up very irregularly. One seed bursts the
enveloping case, and gets up in three weeks; another
barely achieves the same work in three years. And it has
been thus with the harder-coated germens of the <i>Wealth of
Nations</i>. It is now exactly eighty years since the philosopher
set himself to elaborate the thinking of his great
work in his mother&#8217;s house in Kirkcaldy, and exactly
seventy years since he gave it to the world. It appeared
in 1776; and now, for the first time, in 1846, the Queen&#8217;s
Speech, carefully concocted by a Conservative Ministry,
embodies as great practical truths its free-trade principles.
The shoot&ndash;&ndash;a true dicotyledon&ndash;&ndash;has fairly got its two
vigorous lobes above the surface: freedom of trade in all
that the farmer rears, and freedom of trade in all that the
manufacturer produces; and there cannot be a shadow of
doubt that it will be by and by a very vigorous tree. No
Protectionist need calculate, from its rate of progress in the
past, on its rate of progress in the future. Nearly three
generations have come and gone since, to vary the figure,
the preparations for laying the train began; but now that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
the train is fairly ready and fired, the explosion will not be
a matter of generations at all. Explosions come under an
entirely different law from the law of laying trains. It will
happen with the rising of the free-trade agitation as with
the rising of water against a dam-head stretched across a
river. Days and weeks may pass, especially if droughts
have been protracted and the stream low, during which the
rising of the water proves to be a slow, silent, inefficient
sort of process, of half-inches and eighth-parts; but when
the river gets into flood,&ndash;&ndash;when the vast accumulation
begins to topple over the dam-dyke,&ndash;&ndash;when the dyke itself
begins to swell, and bulge, and crack, and to disgorge, at
its ever-increasing flaws and openings, streams of turbid
water,&ndash;&ndash;let no one presume to affirm that the after-process
is to be slow. In mayhap one minute more, in a few
minutes at most, stones, sticks, turf, the whole dam-dyke,
in short, but a dam-dyke no longer, will be roaring adown
the stream, wrapped up in the womb of an irresistible wave.
Now there have been palpable openings, during the last
few months, in the Protectionist dam-head. We pointed
years since to the rising of the water, and predicted that it
would prevail at last. But the droughts were protracted,
and the river low. Good harvests and brisk trade went
hand in hand together; and the Protectionist dam-head&ndash;&ndash;though
feeble currents and minute waves beat against it,
and the accumulation within rose by half-inches and eighth-parts&ndash;&ndash;stood
sure. But the river is now high in flood&ndash;&ndash;the
waters are toppling over&ndash;&ndash;the yielding masonry has begun
to bulge and crack. The Queen&#8217;s Speech, when we consider
it as emanating from a Conservative Ministry, indicates
a tremendous flaw; the speech of Sir Robert Peel
betrays an irreparable bulge; the sudden conversions to
free-trade principles of officials and place-holders show a
general outpouring at opening rents and crannies: depend
on it, Protectionists, your dam-dyke, patch or prop it as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
you please, is on the eve of destruction; yet a very little
longer, and it will be hurtling down the stream.</p>
<p>For what purpose, do we say? Simply in the hope of
awakening to a sense of their true interest, ere it be too
late, a class of the Scottish people in which we feel deeply
interested,&ndash;&ndash;we mean the tenant agriculturists of the kingdom.
They have in this all-important crisis a battle to
fight; and if they do not fight and win it, they will be irrevocably
ruined by hundreds and thousands. The great
Protectionist battle&ndash;&ndash;the battle in which they may make
common cause with their landlords if they will, against the
League, and the Free-Trade Whigs, and Sir Robert Peel,
and Adam Smith, and the Queen&ndash;&ndash;is a battle in which to
a certainty they will be beat. They may protract the contest
long enough to get so thoroughly wearied as to be no
longer fit for the other great battle which awaits them; but
they may depend on it as one of the surest things in all the
future, that they will have to record a disastrous issue.
They <i>must</i> be defeated. We would fain ask them&ndash;&ndash;for it
is sad to see men spending their strength to no end&ndash;&ndash;to
look fairly at the aspect things are beginning to wear, and
the ever-extending front which is arraying against them.
We would ask them first to peruse those chapters in Adam
Smith which in reality form the standing-ground of their
opponents,&ndash;&ndash;chapters whose solid basis of economic philosophy
has made anti-corn-law agitation and anti-corn-law
tracts and speeches such formidable things. We would
ask them next to look at the progress of the League, at its
half-million fund, its indomitable energy and ever-growing
influence. We would then ask them to look at the recent
conversions of Whig and Tory to free-trade principles, at
the resignation of Sir Robert Peel, and the proof the
country received in consequence, that in the present extremity
there is no other pilot prepared to take the helm;
at the strangely marked Adam Smith cast of the Queen&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
Speech; and at the telling facts of Sir Robert&#8217;s explanatory
statement. We request them to take a cool survey of all
these things, and to cogitate for themselves the issue which
they so clearly foretell. It seems as certain that free-trade
principles are at last to be established in Britain, as that
there is a sun in the sky. Nor does there seem much
wisdom in fighting a battle that is inevitably to be lost.
The battle which it is their true interest to be preparing to
fight, is one in which they must occupy the ground, not of
agriculturists, but simply of tenants: it is a battle with the
landlords, not with the free-traders.</p>
<p>We believe Dr. Chalmers is right in holding that, ultimately
at least, the repeal of the corn-laws will not greatly
affect the condition of our agriculturists. There is, however,
a transition period from which they have a good deal
to dread. The removal of the protective duties on meat
and wool has not had the effect of lowering the prices of
either; but the fear of such an effect did for a time what
the repeal of the duties themselves failed to do, and bore
with disastrous consequences on the sheep and cattle
market. And such a time may, we are afraid, be anticipated
on the abolition of the corn-laws. Nay, it is probable
that, even when the transition state shall be over, there will
be a general lowering of price to the average of that of the
Continent and America,&ndash;&ndash;an average heightened by little
more than the amount of the true protective duties of the
trade,&ndash;&ndash;the expense of carriage from the foreign farm to the
British market. And woe to the poor tenant, tied down by
a long lease to a money-rent rated according to the average
value of grain under the protective duties, if the defalcation
is to fall on him! If he has to pay the landlord according
to a high average, and to be paid by the corn-factor according
to a low one, he is undone. And his real danger in
the coming crisis indicates his proper battle. It is not with
his old protector Sir Robert that he should be preparing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
to fight; it is, we repeat, with his old ally the landholder.
Nay, he will find, ultimately at least, that he has
no choice in the matter. With Sir Robert he <i>may</i> fight if
it please him, and fight, as we have shown, to be beaten;
but with the landlord he <i>must</i> fight, whether he first enter
the lists with Sir Robert or no. When his preliminary
struggle shall have terminated unsuccessfully, he shall then
without heart, without organization, without ally, have to
enter on the inevitable struggle,&ndash;&ndash;a struggle for very existence.
We of course refer to landlords as a class: there
are among them not a few individuals with whom the
tenant will have no struggle to maintain,&ndash;&ndash;conscientious
men, at once able and willing to adjust their demands to
the circumstances of the new state of things. But their
character as a class does not stand so high. Many of their
number are in straitened circumstances,&ndash;&ndash;so sorely burdened
with annuities and mortgages, as to be somewhat in
danger of being altogether left, through the coming change,
without an income; and it is not according to the nature
of things that the case of the tenant should be very considerately
dealt with by them. When a hapless crew are
famishing on the open sea, and the fierce cannibal comes
to be developed in the man, it is the weaker who are first
devoured. Now we would ill like to see any portion of
our Scotch tenantry at the mercy of wild, unreasoning
destitution in the proprietor. We would ill like to see him
vested with the power to decide absolutely in his own case,
whether it was his tenant that was to be ruined, or he himself
that was to want an income, knowing well beforehand
to which side the balance would incline. Nor would we
much like to see our tenantry at the mercy of even an
average class of proprietors, by no means in the extreme
circumstances of their poorer brethren, but who, with an
unimpeachable bond in their hands, that enabled them to
say whether it was they themselves or their tenant neighbours
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
who were to be the poorer in consequence of the
induced change, would be but too apt, in accordance with
the selfish bent of man&#8217;s common nature, to make a somewhat
Shylock-like use of it. Stout men who have fallen
into reduced circumstances, and stout paw-sucking bears in
their winter lodgings, become gradually thin by living on
their own fat; and quite right it is that gross men and
corpulent bears <i>should</i> live on their own fat, just because
the fat is their own. But we would not deem it right that
our proprietors should live on their farmers&#8217; fats: on the
contrary, we would hold it quite wrong, and a calamity to
the country; and such, at the present time, is the great
danger to which the tenantry of Scotland are exposed. Justice
imperatively demands, that if some such change is now
to take place in the value of farms, as that which took place
on the regulation of the currency in the value of money,
the ruinous blunder of 1819 should not be repeated. It
demands that their actual rent be not greatly increased
through the retention of the merely nominal one; that the
tenant, in short, be not sacrificed to a term wholly unchanged
in sound, but altogether altered in value. And
such, in reality, is the object for which the farm-holding
agriculturists of Scotland have now to contend. It is the
only quarrel which they can prosecute with a hope of
success.</p>
<p>We referred, in a recent number, when remarking on the
too palpable unpopularity of the Whigs, to questions which,
if animated by a really honest regard for the liberties of the
subject, they might agitate, and grow strong in agitating,
secure of finding a potent ally in the moral sense of the
country. One of these would involve the emancipation of
the tenantry of England, now sunk, through one of the provisions
of the Reform Bill, into a state of vassalage and
political subserviency without precedent since at least the
days of Henry VIII. It has been well remarked by Paley,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
that the direct consequences of political innovations are
often the least important; and that it is from the silent and
unobserved operation of causes set at work for different purposes,
that the greatest revolutions take their rise. &#8216;Thus,&#8217;
he says, &#8216;when Elizabeth and her immediate successor
applied themselves to the encouragement and regulation of
trade by many wise laws, they knew not that, together with
wealth and industry, they were diffusing a consciousness of
strength and independency which could not long endure,
under the forms of a mixed government, the dominion
of arbitrary princes.&#8217; And again: &#8216;When it was debated
whether the Mutiny Act&ndash;&ndash;the law by which the army is
governed and maintained&ndash;&ndash;should be temporal or perpetual,
little else probably occurred to the advocates of
an annual bill, than the expediency of retaining a control
over the most dangerous prerogative of the Crown&ndash;&ndash;the
direction and command of a standing army; whereas, in
its effect, this single reservation has altered the whole
frame and quality of the British constitution. For since,
in consequence of the military system which prevails in
neighbouring and rival nations, as well as on account of
the internal exigencies of Government, a standing army has
become essential to the safety and administration of the
empire, it enables Parliament, by discontinuing this necessary
provision, so to enforce its resolutions upon any other
subject, as to render the king&#8217;s dissent to a law which has
received the approbation of both Houses, too dangerous an
experiment any longer to be advised.&#8217; And thus the illustration
of the principle runs on. We question, however,
whether there be any illustration among them more striking
than that indirect consequence of the Reform Bill on the
tenantry of England to which we refer. The provision
which conferred a vote on the tenant-at-will, abrogated
leases, and made the tiller of the soil a vassal. The farmer
who precariously holds his farm from year to year cannot,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
of course, be expected to sink so much capital in the soil,
in the hope of a distant and uncertain return, as the lessee
certain of a possession for a specified number of years;
but some capital he must sink in it. It is impossible,
according to the modern system, or indeed any system of
husbandry, that all the capital committed to the earth in
winter and spring should be resumed in the following
summer and autumn. A considerable overplus must inevitably
remain to be gathered up in future seasons; and this
overplus remainder, in the case of the tenant-at-will, is
virtually converted into a deposit, lodged in the hands of
the landlord, to secure the depositor&#8217;s political subserviency
and vassalage. Let him but once manifest a will
and a mind of his own, and vote, in accordance with his
convictions, contrary to the will of the landlord, and
straightway the deposit, converted into a penalty, is forfeited
for the offence. It is surely not very great Radicalism
to affirm that a state of things so anomalous ought
not to exist&ndash;&ndash;that the English tenant should be a freeman,
not a serf&ndash;&ndash;and that he ought not to be bound down by a
weighty penalty to have no political voice or conscience
of his own. The simple principle of &#8216;No lease, no vote,&#8217;
would set all right; and it is a principle which so recommends
itself to the moral sense as just, that an honest
Whiggism would gain, in agitating its recognition and
establishment, at once strength and popularity. But there
are few Scotch tenants in the circumstances of vassalage
so general in England. They are in circumstances in which
they at least <i>may</i> act independently; and the time is fast
coming in which they must either make a wise, unbiassed
use of their freedom, or be hopelessly crushed for ever.</p>

<a name='CONCLUSION_OF_THE_WAR_IN_AFFGHANISTAN' id='CONCLUSION_OF_THE_WAR_IN_AFFGHANISTAN'></a>
<h2>CONCLUSION OF THE WAR IN AFFGHANISTAN.</h2>
</div>
<p>We trust we may now look back on by far the most disastrous
passage which occurs in the military history of Great
Britain, as so definitively concluded, that in the future we
shall be unable to trace it as still disadvantageously operative
in its effects. A series of decisive victories has neutralized,
to a considerable extent, the influence of the most
fatal campaign in which a British army was ever engaged.
But this is all. One of our poets, in placing in a strong
light the extreme folly of war, describes &#8216;most Christian
kings&#8217; with &#8216;honourable ruffians in their hire,&#8217; wasting the
nations with fire and sword, and then, when fatigued with
murder and sated with blood, &#8216;setting them down just
where they were before.&#8217; It is quite melancholy enough
that our most sanguine expectations with regard to the
Affghan war should be unable to rise higher by a hair&#8217;s-breadth
than the satiric conception of the poet. We can
barely hope, after squandering much treasure, after committing
a great deal of crime, after occasioning and enduring
a vast amount of wretchedness, after a whole country
has been whitened with the bones of its inhabitants, after
a British army has perished miserably,&ndash;&ndash;we can barely hope
that our later successes may have had so far the effect of
effacing the memory of our earliest disasters, that we shall
be enabled to sit down under their cover on the eastern
bank of the Indus, &#8216;just where we were before.&#8217; And even
this is much in the circumstances.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>We have seen the British in India repeat the same kind
of fatal experiment which cost Napoleon his crown, and
from which Charles XII. dated his downfall; and repeat it,
in the first instance at least, with a result more disastrous
than either the flight from Pultowa or the retreat from
Moscow. And though necessarily an expedition on a
similar scale, it seemed by no means improbable that its
ultimate consequences might bear even more disastrously
on British power in the East, than the results of the several
expeditions into Russia, under Charles and Napoleon, bore
on the respective destinies of Sweden and of France. That
substratum of opinion in the minds of an hundred millions
of Asiatics, on which British authority in India finds its
main foundation, bade fair to be shivered into pieces by the
shock.</p>
<p>There are passages in all our better histories that stand
out in high relief, if we may so speak, from the groundwork
on which they are based. They appeal to the imagination,
they fix themselves in the memory; and after
they have got far enough removed into the past to enable
men to survey them in all their breadth, we find them
caught up and reflected in the fictions of the poet and the
novelist.</p>
<p>But it is wonderful how comparatively slight is the effect
which most of them produce at the time of their occurrence.
It would seem as if the great mass of mankind had
no ability of seeing them in their real character, except
through the medium of some superior mind, skilful enough
to portray them in their true colours and proportions.
Who, acquainted with the history of the plague in London,
for instance, can fail being struck with the horrors of that
awful visitation, as described in the graphic pages of Defoe?
Who, that experienced the visitation of similar horrors which
swept away in our own times one-tenth part of the human
species, could avoid remarking that the reality was less suited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
to impress by its actual presence, than the record by its
touching pictures and its affecting appeals? The reality
appealed to but the fears of men through the instinct of self-preservation,
and even this languidly in some cases, leaving
the imagination unimpressed; whereas the wild scenes of
Defoe filled the whole mind, and impressed vividly through
the influence of that sense of the poetical which, in some
degree at least, all minds are capable of entertaining.</p>
<p>On a nearly similar principle, the country has not yet
been able rightly to appreciate the disasters of Affghanistan.
It has been unable to bestow upon them what we shall
venture to term the historic prominence. When one after
one the messengers reach Job, bearing tidings of fatal
disasters, in which all his children and all his domestics
have perished, the ever-recurring &#8216;and I only am escaped
alone to tell thee,&#8217; strikes upon the ear as one of the signs
of a dispensation supernatural in its character. The narrative
has already prepared us for events removed beyond
the reach of those common laws which regulate ordinary
occurrences. Did we find such a piece of history in any
of our older chronicles, we would at once set it down, on
Macaulay&#8217;s principle, as a ballad thrown out of its original
verse into prose, and appropriated by the chronicler, in the
lack of less questionable materials. But finding it in the
Record of eternal truth, we view it differently; for there
the supernatural is not dissociated from the true. How
very striking, to find in the authentic annals of our own
country a somewhat similar incident; to find the &#8216;I only am
escaped alone to tell thee&#8217; in the history of a well-equipped
British army of the present day! There occurs no similar
incident in all our past history. British armies have capitulated
not without disgrace. In the hapless American
war, Cornwallis surrendered a whole army to Washington,
and Burgoyne another whole army to Gates and Arnold.</p>
<p>The British have had also their disastrous retreats.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>The retreat from Fontenoy was at least precipitate; and
there was much suffered in Sir John Moore&#8217;s retreat on
Corunna. But such retreats have not been wholly without
their share of glory, nor have such surrenders been synonymous
with extermination. In the annals of British armies,
the &#8216;I only have escaped alone to tell thee&#8217; belongs to but
the retreat from Cabul. It is a terrible passage in the history
of our country&ndash;&ndash;terrible in all its circumstances. Some of
its earlier scenes are too revolting for the imagination to
call up.</p>
<p>It is all too humiliating to conceive of it in the character
of an unprincipled conspiracy of the civilised, horribly
avenged by infuriated savages. It is a quite melancholy
enough object of contemplation, in even its latter stages. A
wild scene of rocks and mountains darkened overhead with
tempest, beneath covered deep with snow; a broken and
dispirited force, struggling hopelessly through the scarce
passable defiles,&ndash;&ndash;here thinned by the headlong assaults of
howling fanatics, insensible to fear, incapable of remorse, and
thirsting for blood,&ndash;&ndash;there decoyed to destruction through
the promises of cruel and treacherous chiefs, devoid alike
of the sense of honour and the feeling of pity; with no
capacity or conduct among its leaders; full of the frightful
recollections of past massacres, hopeless of ultimate escape;
struggling, however, instinctively on amid the unceasing
ring of musketry from thicket and crag, exhibiting mile
after mile a body less dense and extended, leaving behind
it a long unbroken trail of its dead; at length wholly
wasting away, like the upward heave of a wave on a sandy
beach, and but one solitary horseman, wounded and faint
with loss of blood, holding on his perilous course, to tell the
fate of all the others. And then, the long after-season of
grief and suspense among anxious and at length despairing
relations at home, around many a cheerless hearth, and in
many a darkened chamber, and the sadly frequent notice in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
the obituaries of all our public journals, so significant of
the disaster, and which must have rung so heavy a knell to
so many affectionate hearts, &#8216;Killed in the Khyber Pass.&#8217;
To find passages of parallel calamity in the history of at
least civilised countries, we have to ascend to the times of
the Roman empire during its period of decline and disaster,
when one warlike emperor, in battle with the Goth,</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span style='margin-left: 3.90625em;'>&#8216;in that Serbonian bog,</span><br />
Betwixt Damieta and Mount Cassus old,<br />
With his whole army sank;&#8217;<br /></p>
</div>
<p>or when another not less warlike monarch was hopelessly
overthrown by the Persian, and died a miserable slave,
exposed to every indignity which the invention of his ungenerous
and barbarous conqueror could suggest.</p>
<p>Britain in this event has received a terrible lesson, which
we trust her scarce merited and surely most revolting successes
in China will not have the effect of wholly neutralizing.
The Affghan war, regarded as a war of principle,
was eminently unjust; regarded as a war of expediency, it
was eminently imprudent. It seems to have originated
with men of narrow and defective genius, not over largely
gifted with the moral sense. We have had to refer on a
former occasion to the policy adopted by Lord Auckland
respecting the educational grants to Hindustan. An enlightened
predecessor of his Lordship had decided that the
assistance and patronage of the British Government should
be extended to the exclusive promotion of European literature
and science among the natives of India. His Lordship,
in the exercise of a miserable liberalism, reversed the
resolution, and diverted no inconsiderable portion of the
Government patronage to the support of the old Hindustanee
education,&ndash;&ndash;a system puerile in its literature, contemptible
in its science, and false in its religion. Our
readers cannot have forgotten the indignant style of Dr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
Duff&#8217;s remonstrance. The enlightened and zealous missionary
boldly and indignantly characterized the minute of
his Lordship, through which this revolution was effected,
as &#8216;remarkable chiefly for its omissions and commissions,
for its concessions and compromises, for its education
without religion, its plans without a Providence, and its
ethics without a God.&#8217; Such was the liberalism of Lord
Auckland; and of at least one of the leading men whose
counsel led to the Affghan expedition, and who perished in
it, the <i>liberalism</i>, it is said, was of a still more marked and
offensive character. What do we infer from the fact?</p>
<p>Not that Providence interfered to avenge upon them the
sin of their policy: there would be presumption in the
inference. But it may not be unsafe to infer, from the
palpable folly of the Affghan expedition, that the <i>liberalism</i>
in which Lord Auckland and some one or two of his friends
indulged is a liberalism which weak and incompetent men
are best fitted to entertain. His scheme of education and
his Affghanistan expedition are specimens of mental production,
if we may so speak, that give evidence of exactly
the same cast and tendency regarding the order and scope
of the genius which originated them. We have been a good
deal struck by the shrewdness of one of Prince Eugene
of Savoy&#8217;s remarks, that seems to bear very decidedly on
this case. Two generals of his acquaintance had failed
miserably in the conduct of some expedition that demanded
capacity and skill, and yet both of them were unquestionably
smart, clever men. &#8216;I always thought it would turn
out so,&#8217; said the Prince. &#8216;Both these men made open
profession of infidelity; and I formed so low an opinion
of their taste and judgment in consequence, that I made
myself sure they would sooner or later run their heads into
some egregious folly.&#8217;</p>
<p>It is satisfactory in every point of view that Britain should
be at peace with China and the Affghans. War is an evil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
in all circumstances. It is a great evil even when just; it
is a great evil even when carried on against a people who
know and respect the laws of nations. But it is peculiarly
an evil when palpably not a just war, and when carried on
against a barbarous people. It has been stated in private
letters, though not officially, that a soldier of the 44th was
burned alive by the Ghilzies in sight of the English troops,
and that on the approach of the latter the throat of the tortured
victim was cut to ensure his destruction. And it is the
inference of an Indian newspaper from the fact, that such
wretches are not the devoted patriots that they have been
described by some, and that the war with them cannot,
after all, be very unjust. We are inclined to argue somewhat
differently. We believe the Scotch under Wallace
were not at all devoid of patriotism, though they were
barbarous enough to flay Cressingham, and to burn the
English alive at Ayr. We believe further, that an unjust
war is rendered none the less unjust from the circumstance
of its being waged with a savage and cruel people. The
barbarism of the enemy has but the effect of heightening
its horrors, not of modifying its injustice. It is possible
for one civilised man to fight with another, and yet retain
his proper character as a man notwithstanding. But the
civilised man who fights with a wild beast must assume,
during the combat, the character of the wild beast. He
cannot afford being generous and merciful; his antagonist
understands neither generosity nor mercy. The war is of
necessity a war of extermination. And such is always the
character of a war between wild and civilised men. It
takes its tone, not from the civilisation of the one, but from
the cruel savageism of the other.</p>

<h2>PERIODICALISM.</h2>
</div>
<p>The poet Gray held that in a neglected country churchyard,
appropriated to only the nameless dead, there might
lie, notwithstanding, the remains of undeveloped Miltons,
Hampdens, and Cromwells,&ndash;&ndash;men who, in more favourable
circumstances, would have become famous as poets, or
great as patriots or statesmen; and the stanzas in which he
has embodied the reflection are perhaps the most popular
in the language. One-half the thought is, we doubt not,
just. Save for the madness of Charles, Cromwell would
have died a devout farmer, and Hampden a most respectable
country gentleman, who would have been gratefully
remembered for half an age over half a county, and then
consigned to forgetfulness. But the poets rarely die, however
disadvantageously placed, without giving some sign.
Rob Don, the Sutherlandshire bard, owed much less to
nature than Milton did, and so little to learning that he
could neither read nor write; and yet his better songs promise
to live as long as the Gaelic language. And though
both Burns and Shakespeare had very considerable disadvantages
to struggle against, we know that neither of
them remained &#8216;mute&#8217; or &#8216;inglorious,&#8217; or even less extensively
known than Milton himself. It is, we believe, no
easy matter to smother a true poet. The versifiers, placed
in obscure and humble circumstances, who for a time complain
of neglected merit and untoward fate, and then give up
verse-making in despair, are always men who, with all their
querulousness, have at least one cause of complaint more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
than they ever seem to be aware of,&ndash;&ndash;a cause of complaint
against the nature that failed to impart to them &#8216;the divine
vision and faculty.&#8217; There are powers, however, admirably
fitted to tell with effect in the literature of the country, for
they have served to produce the most influential works
which the world ever saw&ndash;&ndash;works such as the <i>Essay</i> of
Locke, the <i>Peace and War</i> of Grotius, and the <i>Spirit of
Laws</i> of Montesquieu&ndash;&ndash;which, with all their apparent
robustness, are greatly less hardy than the poetic faculty,
and which, unless the circumstances favourable to their
development and exercise be present, fail to leave behind
them any adequate record of their existence. It is difficult
to imagine a situation in life in which Burns would not
have written his songs, but very easy to imagine situations
in which Robertson would not have produced his <i>Scotland</i>
or his <i>Charles V.</i>, nor Adam Smith his <i>Wealth of Nations</i>.
We have no faith whatever in &#8216;mute, inglorious Miltons;&#8217;
but we do hold that there may be obscure country churchyards
in which untaught Humes, guiltless of the <i>Essay on
Miracles</i>, may repose, and undeveloped Bentleys and Warburtons,
whose great aptitude for acquiring or capacity for
retaining knowledge remained throughout life a mere ungratified
thirst.</p>
<p>It has remained for the present age to throw one bar
more in the way of able men of this special class than our
fathers ever dreamed of; and this, curiously enough, just
by giving them an opportunity of writing much, and of
thinking incessantly. It is not, it would seem, by being
born among ploughmen and mechanics, and destined to
live by tilling the soil, or by making shoes or hobnails, that
the &#8216;genial current of the soil is frozen,&#8217; and superior talents
prevented from accomplishing their proper work: it is by
being connected with some cheap weekly periodical, or
twice or thrice a week newspaper, and compelled to scribble
on almost without pause or intermission for daily bread.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
We have been led to think of this matter by an interesting
little volume of poems, chiefly lyrical, which has just issued
from the Edinburgh press,&ndash;&ndash;the production of Mr. Thomas
Smibert, a man who has lived for many years by his pen, and
who introduces the volume by a prefatory essay, interesting
from the glimpse which it gives of the literary disadvantages
with which the professionally literary man who writes for
the periodicals has to contend. Periodical literature is, he
remarks, &#8216;to all intents and purposes a creation of the
nineteenth century, in its principal existing phases, from
Quarterly Reviews to Weekly Penny Magazines. Newspapers,&#8217;
he adds, &#8216;may justly be accounted the growth of
the same recent era, the few previously published having
been scarcely more than mere Gazettes, recording less
opinions than bare public and business facts.&#8217; The number
of both classes of periodicals is now immensely great; and
&#8216;equally vast, of necessity, is the amount of literary talent
statedly and unremittingly engaged on these journals, while
a large additional amount of similar talent finds in them
occasional and ready outlets for its working.&#8217; &#8216;When one
or two leading Reviews, Quarterlies, and Monthlies alone
existed, they called for no insignificant individual efforts of
mind on the part of their chief conductors and supporters,
and those parties almost took rank with the authors of single
works of importance. But within the last twenty years
periodical literature has become extensively hebdomadal,
and even diurnal; and, as a necessary consequence, the
essays of those sustaining it in this shape have decreased
in proportionate value, at once from the larger amount of
work demanded, and from the shorter time allowed for its
execution. Such essays may serve the hour fairly, but can
seldom be of high worth ultroneously.&#8217; &#8216;The extent and
variety of the labours called for at the hands of those
actively engaged on modern cheap periodicals can scarcely
be conceived by the uninitiated public. If their eyes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
opened on the subject, they would certainly wonder less
why it is that the literary talent of the current generation
does not tend to display itself by striking isolated efforts:
they would also more readily understand wherefore parties
in the situation of the present writer may well experience
some unsatisfactory feelings in looking back on the labours
of the past. Though years spent in respectable periodical
writing can by no means be termed misspent, yet such a
career presents in the retrospect but a multitude of disconnected
essays on all conceivable themes, and such as
too often prove their hurried composition by crudeness and
imperfections.&#8217; The consideration of such a state of things
&#8216;may furnish a salutary lesson to the many among the
young at this day, who, possessing some literary taste,
imagine that the engagements of common life alone stand
in the way of its successful development, and that to be
enabled to pursue a life of professional writing in any shape
would secure to them both fame and fortune to the height
of their desires. They here err sadly. No doubt supereminent
talents will sooner or later make themselves felt
under almost any circumstances; but the position described
assuredly offers no peculiar advantages for the furtherance
of that end. Ebenezer Elliot, leaving his forge at eve with
a wearied body, could yet bring to his favourite leisure tasks
a mind less jaded than that of the <i>litt&eacute;rateur</i> by profession.&#8217;
&#8216;The regular periodicalist, too, of the modern class has
usually no more stable interest in his compositions than
has the counting-house clerk in the cash-books which he
keeps. To publishers and conductors fall the lasting fruits.
Let those among the young who feel the ambition to seek
fame and fortune in the walks of literature think well of
these things, and, above all, ponder seriously ere they quit,
with such views, any fixed occupation of another kind.&#8217;</p>
<p>There is certainly food for thought here; and that, too,
thought of a kind in which the public has a direct interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
If such be the dissipating effect of <i>writing</i> for newspapers
and the lighter periodicals, it is surely natural to infer that
the exclusive <i>reading</i> of such works must have a dissipating
effect also. It is too obvious that the feverish mediocrity
of overwrought brains becomes infectious among the class
who place themselves in too constant and unbroken connection
with it, and that from the closets of over-toiled
<i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i> an excited superficiality creeps out upon the age.
And hence the necessity to which we have oftener than
once referred, that men should keep themselves in wholesome
connection with the master minds of the past. Mr.
Smibert&#8217;s remarks preface, as we have said, a volume of
sweet and tasteful verse; and we find him saying that, &#8216;most
of all, the operation of Periodicalism has been unfavourably
felt in the domain of poetry.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;The position of literature,&#8217; he adds, &#8216;in the times of the
Wordsworths, Crabbes, and Campbells of the age just gone
by, was more favourable than at present to the devotion of
talent to great undertakings. These men were assuredly
not beset by the same seductive facilities as the <i>litt&eacute;rateurs</i>
of the current generation for expending their powers on
petty objects,&ndash;&ndash;facilities all the more fascinating, as comprising
the pleasures of immediate publicity, and perhaps
even of repute for a day, if not also of some direct remuneration.
These influences of full-grown Periodicalism
extend now to all who can read and write. But it entices
most especially within its vortex those who exhibit an
unusually large share of early literary promise, involves
them in multitudinous and multifarious occupation, and,
in short, divides and subdivides the operations of talent,
until all prominent identity is destroyed, both in works and
workers. To the growth of this modern system, beyond
question, is largely to be referred the comparative disappearance
from among us of great literary individualities; or, to
use other and more accurate words, by that system have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
men of capacity been chiefly diverted from the composition
of great individual works, and more particularly great poems.&#8217;</p>
<p>We are less sure of the justice of this remark of Mr.
Smibert&#8217;s, than of that of many of the others. It is not
easy, we have said, to smother a true poet; and we know
that in the present age very genuine poetry has been
produced in the offices of very busy newspaper editors.
Poor Robert Nicoll never wrote truer poetry than when
he produced his &#8216;Puir Folk&#8217; and his &#8216;Saxon Chapel,&#8217; at
a time when he was toiling, as even modern journalist has
rarely toiled, for the columns of the <i>Leeds Times</i>; and James
Montgomery produced his &#8216;World before the Flood,&#8217; &#8216;Greenland,&#8217;
and &#8216;The Pelican Island,&#8217; with many a sweet lyric of
still higher merit, when laboriously editing the <i>Sheffield Iris</i>.
The &#8216;Salamandrine&#8217; of Mr. Charles Mackay was written
when he was conducting the sub-editorial department of a
daily London paper; nor did he ever write anything superior
to it. And we question whether Mr. Smibert himself, though
he might have produced longer poems, would have written
better ones than some of those contained in the present
volume, even had his life been one of unbroken leisure. It
seems natural to literary men, who fail in realizing their
own conceptions of what they had wished and hoped to perform,
to cast the blame upon their circumstances. Johnson
could speak as feelingly, not much later than the middle
of the last century, of the &#8216;dreams of a poet doomed at last
to wake a lexicographer,&#8217; as any literary man of the present
time, who, while solicitously desirous to give himself wholly
to the muses, is compelled to labour as a periodicalist for
the wants of the day that is passing over him. But perhaps
the best solace for the dissatisfaction which would thus
wreak itself on mere circumstances, is that which Johnson
himself supplies. &#8216;To reach below his own aim,&#8217; says the
moralist, &#8216;is incident to every one whose fancy is active,
and whose views are comprehensive; nor is any man satisfied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
with himself because he has done much, but because
he can conceive little.&#8217; But to labour and be forgotten is
the common lot; and why should a literary man be more
disposed to repine because his productions perish after
serving a temporary purpose, than the gardener or farmer,
whose vocation it is to supply the people with their daily
food? If the provisions furnished, whether for mind or
body, be wholesome, and if they serve their purpose, the
producers must learn to be content, even should they
serve the purpose only once, and but for a day. The
danger of over-cropping, and of consequent exhaustion, is,
of course, another and more serious matter; and of this the
mind of the periodicalist is at least as much in danger as
either field or garden when unskilfully wrought. But mere
rest, which in course of time restores the exhausted earth,
is often not equally efficient in restoring the exhausted
mind; nor does mere rest, even were it a specific in the
case, lie within the reach of the periodic writer. It is often
the luxury for which he pants, but which he cannot command.
One of the surest specifics in the case is, the
specific of working just a little more,&ndash;&ndash;of working for the
work&#8217;s sake, whether at poem or history, or in the prosecution
of some science, or in some antiquarian pursuit.
There is an exquisite passage in one of the essays of
Washington Irving, in which he compares the great authors&ndash;&ndash;Shakespeare,
for instance&ndash;&ndash;who seem proof against the
mutability of language, to &#8216;gigantic trees, that we see sometimes
on the banks of a stream, which, by their vast and
deep roots, penetrating through the mere surface, and
laying hold on the very foundations of the earth, preserve
the soil around them from being swept away by the ever-flowing
current, and hold up many a neighbouring plant
to perpetuity.&#8217; And such is the service rendered by some
pervading pursuit of an intellectual character, prosecuted
for its own sake, to the intellect of the journalist. It is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
the necessity imposed upon him of taking up subject after
subject in the desultory, disconnected form in which they
chance to arise, and then, after throwing together a few
hastily collected thoughts upon each, of dismissing them
from his mind, that induces first a habit of superficiality,
and finally leaves him exhausted; and the counteractive
course open to him is just to take up some subject on
which the thinking of to-day may assist him in the thinking
of to-morrow, and on which he may be as well informed
and profound as his native capacity permits. All our really
superior newspaper editors have pursued this course&ndash;&ndash;more,
however, we are disposed to think, from the bent of their
nature than from the necessities of their profession; and
the poetical volume of Mr. Smibert shows that he too has
his engrossing pursuit. We recommend his little work to
our readers, as one in which they will find much to interest
and amuse. We have left ourselves little room for quotation;
but the following stanzas, striking, both from their
beauty and from the curious fact which they embody, may
be regarded as no unfair specimen of the whole:&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<h2>&#8216;ANNUS MIRABILIS.&#8217;</h2>
</div>
<p>We have now reached the close of the most wonderful year
the world ever saw. None of our readers can be unacquainted
with the poem in which Dryden celebrated the
marvels of the year 1666,&ndash;&ndash;certainly an extraordinary
twelvemonth, though the English poet, only partially acquainted
with the events which rendered it so remarkable,
restricts himself, in his long series of vigorous quatrains, to
the description of the two naval battles with the Dutch
which its summer witnessed, and of the great fire of London
which rendered its autumn so remarkable.</p>
<p>He might also have told that it was a year of great fear
and expectation among both Christians and Jews. The
Jews held that their Messiah was to come that year;
and, in answer of the expectation, the impostor Sabbatei
Levi appeared to delude and disappoint the hopes of that
unhappy nation. There was an opinion nearly equally
general in the Roman Catholic world, that it would usher
in the Antichrist of New Testament prophecy; while among
English Protestants it was very extensively believed that it
was to witness the end of the world and the final judgment.
It was remarkable, too, as the year in which oppression
first compelled the Scotch Presbyterians of the reign of
Charles II. to assume the attitude of armed resistance, and
as forming, in the estimate of Burnet and other intelligent
Protestants, the fifth great crisis of the Reformed religion
in Europe. And such were the wonders of the <i>Annus</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
<i>Mirabilis</i> of Dryden: two bloody naval engagements; a
great fire; the appearance of a false Messiah; a widely-spread
fear that the end of the world and the coming of
Antichrist were at hand; the revolt from their allegiance to
the reigning monarch of a sorely oppressed body of Christians,
maddened by persecution; and a perilous crisis in
the general history of Protestantism.</p>
<p>The year now at its close has been beyond comparison
more remarkable. In the earlier twelvemonth, no real
change took place in the existing state of things. Its striking
events resembled merely the phenomena of a mid-winter
storm in Greenland, where, over a frozen ocean, moveless
in the hurricane as a floor of rock or of iron, the hail beats,
and the thick whirling snows descend, and, high above
head, the flashings of aurora borealis lend their many-coloured
hues of mystery to the horrors of the tempest.
Its transactions, picturesque rather than important, wholly
failed to affect the framework of society. That floor of ice
which sealed down the wide ocean of opinion retained all
its mid-winter solidity, and furnished foundations as firm
as before for the old despotic monarchies and the blood-stained
persecuting churches. But how immensely different
the events of the year now at an end! Its tempests have
been, not those of a Greenland winter, but of a Greenland
spring: the depths of society have been stirred to the dark
bottom, where all slimy and monstrous things lie hid, and,
under the irresistible upheavings of the ground-swell, the
ice has broken up; and amid the wide weltering of a
stormy sea, cumbered with the broken ruins of ancient
tyrannies, civil and ecclesiastical, the eye can scarce rest
upon a single spot on which to base a better order of
things. The &#8216;foundations are removed.&#8217; A time of great
trouble has come suddenly upon the kingdoms of Europe&ndash;&ndash;a
time of &#8216;famines, and pestilences, and fearful sights,
and great signs from heaven;&#8217; &#8216;signs in the sun, and in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations,
with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring.&#8217;</p>
<p>The extreme stillness of the calm by which this wide-roaring
tempest has been preceded, forms one of not the
least extraordinary circumstances which impart to it character
and effect. In the <i>Vision of Don Roderick</i>, the fated
monarch is described as pausing for a time amid the deep
silence of a vast hall, pannelled and floored with black
marble, and sentinelled by two gigantic figures of rigid
bronze that stand moveless against the farther wall. The
one, bearing a scythe and sand-glass, is the old giant Time;
the other, armed with an iron mace, is the grim angel of
Destiny. Not a sound or motion escapes them. In that
dim apartment nothing stirs save the sands in the glass,
and the inflexible look of the stern mace-bearing sentinel
marks how they ebb. The last grains are at length moving
downwards&ndash;&ndash;they sink, they disappear; and now, raising
his ponderous mace, he dashes into fragments the marble
wall: a scene of savage warfare gleams livid through the
opening, and the wide vault re-echoes to the hollow tread
of armies, the shrill notes of warlike trumpets, the rude
clash of arms, and the wild shouts of battle. And such,
during the last few years, has been the stillness of the preliminary
pause, and such was the abrupt opening, when the
predestined hour at length arrived, of those clamorous
scenes of revolution and war which impart so remarkable
a character to the year gone by. A twelvemonth has not
yet passed since history seemed to want incident. Time
and Destiny watched as statue-like sentinels in a quiet
hall, walled round by the old rigid conventionalities, and
human sagacity failed to see aught beyond them; the present
so resembled the past, that it seemed over-boldness to
anticipate a different complexion for the future. But, amid
the unbreathing stillness, the appointed hour arrived. The
rigid marble curtain of the old conventionalities was struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
asunder by the iron mace of Destiny; and the silence was
straightway broken by a roar as if of many waters, by the
wrathful shouts of armed millions&ndash;&ndash;the thunderings of
cannon, blent with the rattle of musketry&ndash;&ndash;the wild shrieks
of dismay and suffering&ndash;&ndash;the wailings of sorrow and terror&ndash;&ndash;the
shouts of triumph and exultation&ndash;&ndash;the despairing cry
of sinking dynasties, and the crash of falling thrones. And
with what strange rapidity the visions have since flitted
along the opened chasm!</p>
<p>A royal proclamation forbids in Paris a political banquet;
four short days elapse, and France is proclaimed a Republic,
and Louis Philippe and his Ministers have fled. Britain
at once recognises the Provisional Government; but what
are the great despotisms of the Continent to do? Six days
more pass, and the Canton of Neufchatel declares itself
independent of Prussia. In a few days after, the Duke of
<ins class="trchange" title="Was 'Saxe-Cobourg Gotha'">Saxe-Cobourg-Gotha</ins> grants to his subjects a representative
constitution, freedom of the press, and trial by jury; the
King of Hanover has also to yield, and the King of Bavaria
abdicates. These, however, are comparatively small
matters. But still the flame spreads. There is a successful
insurrection at Vienna, the very stronghold of despotism
in central Europe; and the Prime Minister, Metternich,
the grim personification of the old policy, is compelled to
resign. Then follows an equally successful insurrection at
Berlin; Milan, Vicenza, and Padua are also in open insurrection.
Venice is proclaimed a Republic. Holstein declares
itself independent of Denmark, Hungary of Austria,
Sicily of Naples. Prague and Cracow have also their formidable
outbreaks. Austria and Prussia proclaim new
constitutions. Secondary revolutionary movements in both
Paris and Vienna are put down by the military. There are
bloody battles fought between the Austrians and the Piedmontese
on the one hand, and the Germans and the Danes
on the other; and, in a state of profound peace, the people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
of a British port hear from their shores the boom of the
hostile cannon. The Emperor of Austria abdicates his
throne, the Pope flees his dominions, and a nephew of
Napoleon Bonaparte is elected President of France.
Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, the ebullitions of the
revolutionary element serve but to demonstrate its own
weakness. In both England and Scotland, the moral and
physical force of the country&ndash;&ndash;in reality but one&ndash;&ndash;arrays
itself on the side of good order and the established institutions.
A few policemen put down, without the assistance
of the military, the long-threatened rebellion in Ireland;
and the Sovereign Lady of the empire, after journeying
among her subjects, attended by a retinue which only a
few ages ago would have been deemed slender for a
Scotch chieftain or one of the lesser nobility, and without
a single soldier to protect her, and needing no such protection,
spends her few weeks of autumn leisure in a solitary
Highland valley,&ndash;&ndash;a thousand times more secure in
the affections of a devoted and loyal people than any other
European monarch could have been in the midst of an
army of an hundred thousand men. Such are some of
the wonderful events which have set their stamp on the
year now at its close.</p>
<p>We regard the old state of things as gone for ever. The
foundations have broken up on which the ancient despotisms
were founded. It would seem as if &#8216;the stone cut out
without hands&#8217; had fallen during the past year on the feet
of the great image, and ground down into worthless rubbish
the &#8216;iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold.&#8217; And
&#8216;the wind,&#8217; though not yet risen to its height, seems fast
rising, which will sweep them all away, &#8216;like the chaff of
the summer thrashing-floor;&#8217; so that &#8216;there shall be no place
found for them.&#8217; But while we can entertain no hope for
the old decrepit despotisms, we cannot see in the infidel
liberalism&ndash;&ndash;alike unwise and immoral&ndash;&ndash;by which they are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
in the course of being supplanted, other than a disorganizing
element, out of which no settled order of things can
possibly arise. It takes the character, not of a reforming
principle destined to bless, but of an instrument of punishment,
with which vengeance is to be taken for the crimes
and errors of the past; and, so far at least, a time when we
need expect to witness but the struggles of the two principles&ndash;&ndash;the
old and the new&ndash;&ndash;as they act and react against
each other, stronger and weaker by turns, as they disgust
and alienate by their atrocities in their hour of power such
of the more moderate classes as had taken part with them
in their hour of weakness. It is the grand error of our
leading statesmen, that they fail to appreciate the real character
of the crisis, and would fain deal with the consequent
existing difficulties in that petty style of diplomatic
man&oelig;uvre with which it was their wont to meet the comparatively
light demands of the past. It would seem as if we
had arrived at a stage in the world&#8217;s history in which statesmanship
after this style is to be tolerated no longer. How
instructive, for instance, the mode in which, for the present
at least, an all-governing Providence has terminated the
negotiations of this country with the Pope! Contrary to
the wishes and principles of the sound-hearted portion of
the British people, our leading statesmen open up by statute
their diplomatic relations with the Pope, palpably with the
desire of governing Ireland through the influence of that
utterly corrupt religion which has made that unhappy island
the miserable lazar-house that it is; and, lo! Providence
strikes down the ghostly potentate, and virtually, for the
present, divests him of that &#8216;property qualification&#8217; in virtue
of which the relation can alone be maintained. But not
less infatuated than our statesmen, and even less excusably
so, are those men&ndash;&ndash;professedly religious and Protestant,
but of narrow views and weak understandings&ndash;&ndash;who can
identify the cause of Christ with the old tottering despotisms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
and the soul-destroying policy of princes such as the late
Emperor of Austria, and of ministers such as Metternich. It
would not greatly surprise us to see Protestants of this high
Tory stamp, who have been zealous against Popery all their
lives long, taking part in the &#8216;lament of the merchants and
mariners&#8217; over the perished Babylon, when they find that
the representatives of the Roman Emperors must fall with
the Roman See. There are two wild beasts, like those which
Daniel saw in vision, contending together in fierce warfare,&ndash;&ndash;the
old Babylonish beast, horrid with the <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'bood'">blood</ins> of saints,
and its cruel executioner&ndash;&ndash;the monster of Atheistic Liberalism;
but Christ has identified His cause with neither. No
reprieve from the prince awaits the condemned culprit; and
with the disreputable and savage executioner he will hold
no intercourse. Destruction, from which there is no escape,
awaits equally on both.</p>
<p>We began with a reference to Dryden&#8217;s <i>Year of Wonders:</i>
we conclude with an anecdote regarding that year, connected
with the history of one of the most eminent judges
and best men England ever produced. It needs no application,
showing as it does, with equal simplicity and force,
how and on what principle the terrors of years such as the
&#8216;<i>Annus Mirabilis</i>&#8217; of the seventeenth century, or the &#8216;<i>Annus
Mirabilis</i>&#8217; of our own, may be encountered with the greatest
safety and the truest dignity. We quote from Bishop Burnet&#8217;s
<i>Life of Sir Matthew Hale</i>:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8216;He&#8217; (Sir Matthew), says the Bishop, &#8216;had a generous
and noble idea of God in his mind; and this he found, above
all other considerations, preserve his quiet. And, indeed,
that was so well established in him, that no accidents, how
sudden soever, were observed to discompose him, of which
an eminent man of that profession gave me this instance:&ndash;&ndash;In
the year 1666 an opinion did run through the nation that
the end of the world would come that year. This, whether
set on by astrologers, or advanced by those who thought it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
might have some relation to the number of the beast in the
Revelation, or promoted by men of ill designs to disturb the
public peace, had spread mightily among the people; and
Judge Hale going that year the Western Circuit, it happened
that, as he was on the bench at the assizes, a most terrible
storm fell out very unexpectedly, accompanied with such
flashes of lightning and claps of thunder, that the like will
hardly fall out in an age; upon which a whisper ran through
the crowd, &#8220;that now was the world to end, and the day
of judgment to begin.&#8221; And at this there followed a general
consternation in the whole assembly, and all men forgot the
business they were met about, and betook themselves to
their prayers. This, added to the horror raised by the storm,
looked very dismal, insomuch that my author&ndash;&ndash;a man of
no ordinary resolution and firmness of mind&ndash;&ndash;confessed it
made a great impression on himself. But he told me &#8220;that
he did observe the judge was not a whit affected, and was
going on with the business of the court in his ordinary
manner;&#8221; from which he made this conclusion: &#8220;that his
thoughts were so well fixed, that he believed, if the world
had been really to end, it would have given him no considerable
disturbance!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2>EFFECTS OF RELIGIOUS DISUNION ON COLONIZATION.</h2>
</div>
<p>It is well that there should exist amongst the evangelistic
churches at least a desire for union. We do not think they
will ever be welded into one without much heat and many
blows. Popery, with mayhap Infidelity for its assistant,
will have first to blow up the coals and ply the hammer;
but it is at least something that the various pieces of the
broken and shivered Church catholic should be coming into
contact, drawn together as if by some strong attractive influence,
and that there should be so many attempts made
to fit into each other, though with but indifferent success,
the rough-edged inflexible fragments. It is much that the
attractive influence should exist. Among the many inventions
of modern times, a singularly ingenious one has been
brought to bear on the smelting of iron. A powerful magnetic
current is made to pass in one direction through the
furnace, which imparts to each metallic particle a loadstone-like
affinity for all the others; and no sooner has the
heat set them free, than, instead of sinking, as in the old
process, through the molten stony mass to the bottom,
solely in effect of their superior gravity&ndash;&ndash;a tedious, and in
some degree uncertain process&ndash;&ndash;they at once get into
motion in the line of the current, and unite, in less than
half the ordinary time under any other circumstances, into
a homogeneous, coherent mass. May we not indulge the
expectation of similar results from the magnetic current
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
of attraction, if we may so speak, which has so decidedly
begun to flow through the evangelistic churches? True, so
long as the little bits remain unmolten, however excellent
their quality, they but clash and jangle together, if moved
by the influence at all; but should the furnace come to
be seven times heated, it will scarce fail to give unity of
motion and a prompt coherency to all the genuine metal,
however minute, in its present state, the particles into
which it is separated, or however stubborn the stony matrices
which dissociate these from the other particles, one
in their origin and nature, that lie locked up in the sullen
fragments around.</p>
<p>Never perhaps was there a time when the great disadvantages
of disunion were so pressed in a practical form
on the notice of the churches as at the present. It formed
the complaint of one of our better English writers considerably
more than a century ago, that we had religion
enough to make us hate, but not enough to make us love,
one another. At that time, however, sects, to employ
one of Bacon&#8217;s striking phrases, &#8216;had not so grown to
equality&#8217; as now; and storms in the moral world, as in the
natural &#8216;at the equinoxia,&#8217; when night and day are equal,
are commonly greatest, adds the philosopher, &#8216;when things
do grow to equality.&#8217; The unestablished Protestant denominations
formed in the times of Queen Anne a mere
feeble moiety, that could raise no efficient voice against the
established religion; and Popery, newly thrust under feet,
after a formidable struggle, that threatened to overturn the
constitution of the country, had no voice at all. Matters
are very different now: things have grown to an equality;
night and day, as &#8216;at the equinoxia,&#8217; have become nearly
equal; and society can scarce take one step for the general
benefit, without experiencing, as a thwarting and arresting
influence, the effects of religious difference. Do we regret
that the Government of a country such as ours should be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
practically irreligious in its character? Alas! were every
Government functionary in the empire a thoroughly religious
man, Government could not act otherwise than it does in
not a few instances, just in consequence of our religious
differences. Are there millions of the people sinking into
brutality and ignorance, and do our rulers originate a
scheme of education in their behalf?&ndash;&ndash;our religious differences
straightway step in to arrest and cripple the design.
Are there whole districts of country subjected to famine,
and are we roused, both as Britons and as Christians, to
contribute of our substance for their relief?&ndash;&ndash;our religious
differences immediately interfere; and a Church greatly
more identified by membership with the sufferers than any
other, has to fight a hard battle ere she can be permitted
to co-operate in the general cause. Is there a ragged-school
scheme originated in the capital, to rescue the
neglected perishing young among us from out the very
jaws of destruction?&ndash;&ndash;forthwith rival institutions start up,
on the ground of religious differences, to dwarf one another
into inefficiency, like starveling shrubs in a nursery run
wild; and projected exertions in the cause of degraded
and suffering humanity degenerate into an attack on a
benevolent Presbyterian minister, who refuses to accept,
from conscientious motives, of a directorship in a Popish
institution. This is surely a sad state of things,&ndash;&ndash;a state
grown very general, and which threatens to become more
so; and in a due sense of the weakness for all good which
it creates, and of the palpable state of disorganization and
decomposition favourable to the growth of every species
of evil, physical and moral, which it induces, we recognise
at least one of the causes of the general desire for union.
To no one circumstance has Rome owed more of its success
than to the divisions of the Protestant Church; and
great as that success has been in our own country, where,
as &#8216;at the equinoxia,&#8217; day and night are fast &#8216;growing to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
equality,&#8217; it is but slight compared with what she has experienced
in America and the colonies. It is a serious consideration
in an age like the present, in which the country
looks to emigration for relief from the pressure of a superabundant
population, that religion has suffered more in the
colonies from its sectarian divisions, than from every other
cause put together.</p>
<p>The way in which the mischief comes to be done is
easily conceivable. The Protestant emigrants of the country
quit it always, with regard to their churchmanship, as a mere
undisciplined rabble. The Episcopalian sets sail in the
same vessel, and for the same scene of labour, as the Independent&ndash;&ndash;the
Free Churchman with the Baptist&ndash;&ndash;the
Methodist with the Original Seceder&ndash;&ndash;the Voluntary with
the Establishment-man; and they squat down together on
contiguous lots, amid the solitude of the forest. Were they
all of one communion, there might be scarce any break
created in their old habits of church-going and religious instruction.
The community, considerable as a whole, though
very inconsiderable in its parts when broken up into denominational
septs, would have its minister of religion from
its first settlement, or almost so; and, from the rapid increase
which takes place in all new colonies in congenial countries
and climates, the charge of such a minister would be soon
a very important one, and adequate to the full development
of the energies of a superior man.</p>
<p>But alas for the numerous denominational septs! Years
must elapse, in some instances many years, ere&ndash;&ndash;few and
scattered, and necessarily deprived of every advantage of
the territorial system&ndash;&ndash;they can procure for themselves
religious teachers: they fall gradually, in the interim, out
of religious habits, or there rises among them a generation
in which these were never formed; and when at length a
sept does procure a teacher, generally, from the comparative
fewness of their numbers, the extent of district over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
which they are spread, and the lukewarmness induced
among them by their years of deprivation&ndash;&ndash;circumstances
which make the charge of such a people no very desirable
one to a man who can procure aught better, and which
have some effect also in rendering their choice in such
matters not very discriminating&ndash;&ndash;he is frequently of a character
little suited to profit them. They succeed too often
in procuring not missionaries, nor men such as the ministers
of higher standing, that divide the word to the congregations
of the mother country, but the country&#8217;s mere
remainder preachers, who, having failed in making their
way into a living at home, seek unwillingly a bit of bread
in the unbroken ground of the colonies. The circumstances
of Popery as a colonizing religion are in all respects
immensely more favourable. For every practical
purpose, it is one and united: it is furnished with an army
of clergy admirably organized, and set peculiarly loose for
movement at the will of the general ecclesiastical body by
their law of celibacy. It possesses in prolific Ireland a
vast propelling heart, if we may so speak, ever working in
sending out the blood of a singularly bigoted Romanism to
every quarter of the world. It has already begun to influence
the elections of the United States; and should the
Papal superstition be destined to live so long, and should
its membership continue to increase at the present ratio,
there will be as many Papists a century hence in the great
valley of the Mississippi, and the tracts adjacent, as are at
present in all Europe. In no field in the present day has
Rome more decidedly the advantage than in that of colonization;
and it is surely a serious consideration that it
should owe its successes in such large measure to the divisions
of Protestantism.</p>
<p>But these divisions exist, and no amount of regret for
the mischief which they occasion will serve to lessen them.
We are not disposed to give up a single tenet which we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
hold as Free Churchmen; and our brother Protestants of
the other denominations are, we find, quite as tenacious
of their distinctive holdings as ourselves. And so the evils
consequent on disunion in infant colonies and settlements-evils
which, when once originated, continue to propagate
themselves for ages&ndash;&ndash;must continue, in cases of promiscuous
emigration, to be educed, and Rome to profit by them.
We find a vigorous attempt to grapple with the difficulty,
by rendering emigration not promiscuous, but select, originated
by a branch of the New Zealand Company, which
we deem worthy of notice. It is calculated, from the proportion
which they bear to the entire population of the
country, that from a thousand to fifteen hundred Free
Church people emigrate from Scotland every year. A
number equal to a large congregation quit it yearly for
the colonies; but absorbed among all sorts of people&ndash;&ndash;in
Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, the United
States, Australia, and Southern Africa, etc. etc.&ndash;&ndash;these
never reappear as congregations, but are subjected, in their
scattered, atomic state, to the deteriorating process, religious
and educational, to which we have referred as inevitable
under that economy of promiscuous emigration
unhappily so common in these latter times. In an earlier
age the case was different. The Pilgrim Fathers who first
planted New England were so much at one in their tenets,
that they had no difficulty in making the laws of the colony
a foundation on which to erect the platform both of a
general church and of an educational institute; and till
this day, the character, moral and intellectual, of that part
of the States tells of the wisdom of the arrangement. Now
why, argue the Company, might not a similar result be
produced in the present age, by directing the Free Church
portion of the outward stream of emigration, or at least a
sufficient part of it, into one locality? If the disastrous
effects of division cannot be prevented by reconciling the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
disagreements of those who already differ, they may be
obviated surely, to a large extent, by bringing into juxtaposition
those who already agree. And on this simple
principle the Company has founded its Free Church colony
of Otago. Of course, regarding the secular advantages of
the colony, we cannot speak. New Zealand has been long
regarded as the Great Britain of the southern hemisphere.
It possesses for a European constitution peculiar advantages
of climate; the neighbourhood of the settlement, for
several hundred miles together, is deserted by the natives;
Government is pledged to the appointment of a Royal
Commissioner to watch over the interests of Her Majesty&#8217;s
subjects in connection with the Company, and to afford
them protection; the committee for promoting the settlement
of the colony includes some of the most respected
names in the Free Church; and thus, judged by all the
ordinary tests, it seems to promise at least as well as any
other resembling field of enterprise open at the present
time. But respecting the principles involved in this scheme
of colonization, we can speak more directly from the circumstance
that we find them recognised as just and good
by the General Assembly of our Church. The records of
the Assembly of 1845 bear the following deliverance on
the subject:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;The General Assembly learn with great
pleasure the prospect of the speedy establishment of the
Scotch colony of New Edinburgh [now Otago] in New
Zealand, consisting of members of the Free Church, and
with every security for the colonists being provided with
the ordinances of religion and the means of education in
connection with this Church. Without expressing any
opinion regarding the secular advantages or prospects of
the proposed undertaking, the General Assembly highly
approve of the principles on which the settlement is proposed
to be conducted, in so far as the religious and
educational interests of the colonists are concerned; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
the Assembly desire to countenance and encourage the
association in these respects.&#8217;</p>
<p>We have seen the waste of mind which takes place in
the colonies of a very highly civilised country adverted to
in a rather fanciful and rationalistic connection with the
desponding reply of the captive Jews to their spoilers:
&#8216;How shall we sing the Lord&#8217;s song in a strange land?&#8217;
Ages, sometimes whole centuries, elapse, remarks the
commentator, ere the colonies of even eminently literary
nations come to possess poets and fine writers of their
own. There is first a struggle for bare existence among
the colonists, during which the higher branches of learning
are necessarily neglected; and when a better time at length
comes, the general mind is found to have acquired, during
the struggle, a homely and utilitarian cast, which militates
against the right appreciation, and of course the production,
of what is excellent. And thus the true divinities of
song fail to be sung in a foreign land. There is, we doubt
not, truth in the remark, though somewhat quaintly expressed,
and somewhat doubtfully derived. The necessities
of a colony in its youth, and the peculiar cast of mind
which they serve to induce, are certainly not favourable to
the development of poetic genius. But there is, alas! another
and more scriptural sense in which the &#8216;Lord&#8217;s song&#8217; too
often ceases to be sung in a strange land. We have already
adverted to the process of deterioration, moral and religious,
through which it comes to be silenced; and it is one of the
advantages of the Otago scheme, that it makes provision in,
we believe, the most effectual way possible, in the present
divided state of Protestantism, for preventing a result so
deplorable. Youth is an important season, as certainly in
colonies as in individuals; and we question whether the
characteristic recklessness of Yankeeism in the far west
and south may not be legitimately traced to the neglected
youthhead of the States in which it is most broadly apparent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
The deterioration of a single generation left to
run wild may influence for the worse, during whole centuries,
the character of a people; and who can predicate
what these colonies of the southern hemisphere are yet to
become? They may be great nations, influencing for good
or evil the destinies of the species in ages of the world when
Britain shall have sunk into a subordinate power, or shall
have no name save in history. Those records of the past,
from which we learn that states and peoples, as certainly
as families and individuals, are born and die, and have
their times of birth and of burial, may serve to convince
us that the melancholy reflection of one of our later poets
on this subject is by no means a fanciful one:</p>

<a name='FINEBODYISM' id='FINEBODYISM'></a>
<h2>FINE-BODYISM.</h2>
</div>
<p>Of all the dangers to which the Free Church is at present
exposed, we deem the danger of <i>fine-bodyism</i> at once the
least dreaded and the most imminent. And the evil is in
itself no light one: it marks, better than any of the other
<i>isms</i>&ndash;&ndash;even the heresies themselves&ndash;&ndash;the sinking of a
Church that is never to rise again. Churches have been
affected by dangerous heresies both of the hot and the cold
kinds, and have yet shaken them off and recovered. The
Presbyterians of Ireland, now so sound in their creed, were
extensively affected, little more than half a century ago, by
Arian error and the semi-infidelity of Socinus; and the
Church that in 1843 had become vigorous enough to dare
the Disruption, recorded in the year 1796 its vote against
missions, and framed in the year 1798 its law against
church extension. But we know of no Church that ever
recovered from <i>fine-bodyism</i> when the disease had once
fairly settled into its confirmed and chronic state. In at
least this age and country it exists as the atrophy of a
cureless decline. It were well, however, that we should
say what it is we mean by <i>fine-bodyism</i>; and we find we cannot
do better than quote our definition from the first speech
ever delivered by Chalmers in the General Assembly. &#8216;It
is quite ridiculous to say,&#8217; remarked this most sagacious of
men, &#8216;that the worth of the clergy will suffice to keep them
up in the estimation of society. This worth must be combined
with importance. Give both worth and importance
to the same individual, and what are the terms employed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
in describing him? &#8220;A distinguished member of society,
the ornament of a most respectable profession, the virtuous
companion of the great, and a generous consolation to all
the sickness and poverty around him.&#8221; These, Moderator,
appear to me to be the terms peculiarly descriptive of the
appropriate character of a clergyman, and they serve to
mark the place which he ought to occupy; but take away
the importance and leave only the worth, and what do you
make of him? What is the descriptive term applied to him
now? Precisely the term which I often find applied to
many of my brethren, and which galls me to the very bone
every moment I hear it&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;<i>a fine body</i>&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;a being whom you
may like, but whom I defy you to esteem&ndash;&ndash;a mere object
of endearment&ndash;&ndash;a being whom the great may at times
honour with the condescension of a dinner, but whom they
will never admit as a respectable addition to their society.
Now, all that I demand from the Court of Teinds is to be
raised, and that as speedily as possible, above the imputation
of being &#8220;<i>a fine body</i>;&#8221; that they would add importance
to my worth, and give splendour and efficacy to those
exertions which have for their object the most exalted interests
of the species.&#8217;</p>
<p>The Free Church has for ever closed her connection
with the Court of Teinds; but her danger from <i>fine-bodyism</i>
is in consequence all the greater, not the less. The Sustentation
Fund is her Court of Teinds now; and it is to it
that she has in the first instance to look for protection from
the all-potent but insidious and vastly under-estimated evil
under which no Church ever throve. The outed ministers
are comparatively safe. Unless prudence be altogether
wanting, and the wolf comes to the door, not, as in the
child&#8217;s story-book, in the disguise of a soft-voiced girl, but
in that of a gruff sheriff&#8217;s officer, they will continue to bear
through life the old status of the Establishment, heightened
by the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of the Disruption. But our younger men of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
subsequent appointment stand on no such platform, nor
will any of their contemporaries or successors step upon it
as a matter of course when the heroes of the conflict have
dropped away, and they come to occupy their vacant places.
Their status will be found to depend on two circumstances,
neither of them derived from the men of a former time&ndash;&ndash;on
their ability to maintain a respectable place among the
middle classes, and on their scholastic acquirements and
general manners. A half-paid, half-taught, half-bred minister
of religion may be a very excellent man; we have seen
such, both in England and our own country, among the
non-Presbyterian Dissenters who laboured to do well, and
were exceedingly in earnest; but no such type of minister
will ever be found influential in Scotland, either in extending
the limits of a Church, or in benefiting the more intelligent
classes of the people. And the two circumstances of
acquirement and remuneration will be found indissolubly
connected. A Church of under-paid ministers, however
fairly it may start, will, in the lapse of a generation, become
a Church of under-taught and under-bred ministers also.
Nor is there any chance that the evil, once begun, will ever
cure itself, for the under-bred and the under-taught will be
sure to continue the under-paid. That animating spirit of a
Church, without which wealth and learning avail but little,
money now, as of old, cannot buy; but the secular will be
ever found to depend on the secular,&ndash;&ndash;the general rate of
secular acquirement on the general rate of secular remuneration;
and unless both be pitched at a level very considerably
above that of the labouring laity, which constitutes the
great bulk of congregations, even the better ministers of a
Church need not expect to escape <i>fine-bodyism</i>. And once
infected with this fatal indisposition, they must be content
to suffer, among other evils, the evil of being permitted to
lay whatever claim to status they may choose, without
challenge or contradiction. &#8216;Oh yes,&#8217; it will be said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
should they assert that their Church is the Church of the
nation, and that it is they themselves, and not the ministers
of the Establishment, who are on the true constitutional
ground,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Oh yes, Church of the nation, or, if ye will,
Church of the whole world, or, in short, anything you
please; for you are <i>fine bodies</i>.&#8217; Chalmers exercised all his
sagacity when he demanded of the Court of Teinds &#8216;to be
raised, and that as speedily as possible, above the imputation
of being a <i>fine body</i>.&#8217; And what Chalmers demanded
of the Court of Teinds, every minister of the Free Church
ought to ask of the Sustentation Fund.</p>
<p>But how is the demand to be effectually made? It is
well known to statesmen, who, when they once get a tax
imposed by Parliament, can employ all the machinery of
the police and the standing army&ndash;&ndash;of fines, confiscations,
and prisons&ndash;&ndash;in exacting it, that yet, notwithstanding, in
the arithmetic of finance two and two do not always make
four. There are certain pre-existing laws to be studied&ndash;&ndash;laws
not of man&#8217;s passing, but which arise out of man&#8217;s
nature and the true bearings and relations of things; and
unless these be studied and conformed to, the Parliament-imposed
tax, though backed by the constable and the jail,
will realize but little. And if the statesman must study
these laws, well may the Church do so, who has no constables
in her pay, and to whom no jail-keys have been
entrusted. It ought, we think, to be regarded as one
fundamental law, that whatever has been gained by the
seven years&#8217; establishment of the Fund, should not be
lightly perilled by bold and untried innovations. True,
there may, on the one hand, be danger, if let too much
alone, that its growth should be arrested, and of its passing
into a stunted and hide-bound condition, little capable of
increase; but the danger is at least as great, on the other,
that if subjected to fundamental changes, it might lose that
advantage of permanency which whatever is established
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
possesses in virtue of its being such; and which has its
foundation in habit, and in that vague sense of responsibility
which leads men to give, year after year, what they
had been accustomed to give in the previous years, just
because they had given it. Let it not be forgotten, that
though much still remains to be done in connection with
this Fund, much has been done already&ndash;&ndash;that a voluntary
tax of about eighty thousand pounds per annum, raised
from about one-third, and that by no means the wealthiest
third, of the Scottish people, is really not a small, but a
great one&ndash;&ndash;and that as great, and as worthy of being
desired and equalled, do the other non-endowed Churches
of the country regard it. No tampering, therefore, with its
principle should be attempted: he was an eminently wise
man who first devised and instituted it,&ndash;&ndash;not once in an
age do churches, or even countries, get such men to guide
their affairs,&ndash;&ndash;and it ought by all means to be permitted to
<i>set</i> and consolidate in the mould which he formed for it.
We would apply in this case the language of a philosophic
writer of the last age, when speaking of government in
general:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;An established order of things,&#8217; he said, &#8216;has
an infinite advantage, by the very circumstance of its being
established. To tamper, therefore, to try experiments upon
it, upon the credit of supposed fitness and improvement,
can never be the part of a wise man, who will bear a reverence
for what carries the marks of the stability of age; and
though he may attempt some improvements for the public
good, yet will he adjust his innovations as much as possible
to the ancient fabric, and preserve entire the chief pillars
and supports of the institution.&#8217;</p>
<p>It ought, we hold, to be regarded as another law of the
Fund, that the means taken to increase it should be means
exclusively fitted to lead the givers to think of their <i>duties</i>,
not of their <i>rights</i>. The Sustentation Fund is not the result
of a tax properly so called, but an accumulation of freewill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
offerings rendered to the Church by men who in this
matter are responsible to God only. What the Church
receives on these terms she can divide; but what the
givers do not place at her disposal&ndash;&ndash;what, on the contrary,
they reserve for quite another purpose&ndash;&ndash;she cannot lay
hold of and distribute. It is not hers, but theirs; and the
attempt to appropriate it might be very fatal. Hence the
danger of the question regarding the appropriation for
general purposes of supplements, which was mooted two
years ago, but which was so promptly put down by the
good sense of the Church. It would have led men to
contend for their rights, and, in the struggle, to forget
their duties; and the battle would have been a losing one
for the Fund. We regard it as another law, that the distribution
of the sustentation money entrusted to the Church
should be a distribution, not discretionary, but fixed by
definite enactment. A discretionary licence of distribution,
extended to some central board or committee, even
though under the general review of the Church, could not
be other than imminently dangerous, because opposed in
spirit to the very principle of Presbytery. And if Presbytery
and the Sustentation Fund come into collision in the
Free Church of Scotland, it is not difficult to say which of
the two would go down. It has been shrewdly remarked
by Hume, that in monarchies there is room for discretionary
power&ndash;&ndash;the laws under a great and wise prince
may in some cases be softened, or partially suspended,
and carried into full effect in others; but republics admit
of no such discretionary authority&ndash;&ndash;the laws in them must
in every instance be thoroughly executed, or set aside
altogether. Every act of discretionary authority is treason
against the constitution. And so is it with Presbytery.
Give to a central board or committee the power of sitting
in judgment on the circumstances of ministers of their
body, and of apportioning to one some thirty or forty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
pounds additional, and of cutting down another to the
average dividend, and, for a time at least, the Presbyterian
independence is gone. But the reaction point once
reached&ndash;&ndash;and in the Free Church the process would not
be a very tedious one&ndash;&ndash;the discretionary authority would be
swept away in the first instance, and the Sustentation Fund
not a little damaged in the second. It is of paramount
importance, therefore&ndash;&ndash;a law on no account to be neglected
or traversed&ndash;&ndash;that the distribution of the Fund be regulated
by rules so rigid and unbending, and of such general application,
that the manifestation of favour or the exercise of
patronage on the part of the board or committee authorized
to watch over it may be wholly an impossibility.</p>
<p>It is, in the next place, of importance carefully to scan
the sources whence the expected increase of the Fund is
to come. The givers in the Free Church at the present
time seem to lie very much in extremes. A considerable
number, animated by the Disruption spirit, contribute
greatly more to ministerial support, in proportion to their
incomes, than the old Dissenters of the kingdom; but a
still larger number, reposing indolently on the exertions
of these, and in whom the habit has not been cultivated
or formed, give considerably less. It was stated by Mr.
Melvin, in the meeting of the United Presbyterian Synod
held on Wednesday last, that, &#8216;on an average, the members
of weak congregations in connection with their body contributed
to the support of their minister about 14s. 6d. per
annum, besides about 2s. 6d. for missionary purposes,
while some of them contributed even as high as 25s. to
26s.&#8217; Now, an average rate of contribution liberal as this,
among the members of country congregations in the Free
Church, would at once place the Fund in flourishing circumstances,
and render it, unless its management was very
unwise indeed, sufficient to maintain a ministry high above
the dreaded level of <i>fine-bodyism</i>. Nor do we see why, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
we except the crushed and poverty-stricken people of some
of the poorer Highland districts, Free Church congregations
in the country should not contribute as largely to
church purposes as United Presbyterian congregations in
the same localities. The membership of both belong
generally to the same level of society, and, if equally
willing, are about equally able to contribute. Here, then,
is a field which still remains to be wrought. Something,
too, may be done at the present time, from the circumstance
that the last instalment of the Manse Building Fund is just
in the act of being paid, and those who have been subscribing
for five years to this object, and formed a habit
of periodic giving in relation to it, may be induced to
transfer a portion of what they gave to the permanent
fund, and so continue contributing. Ere, however, they
can be expected to do so, they must be fairly assured that
what they give is to be employed in strengthening and
consolidating the Church, and in raising her ministers above
the level of <i>fine-bodyism</i>, not in adding to her weakness
by adding to her extent. Until a distinct pledge be given
that there shall not be so much as a single new charge
sanctioned until the yearly dividend amounts to at least a
hundred and fifty pounds, we must despair of the Sustentation
Fund. One may hopefully attempt the filling up of a
tun, however vast its contents; but there can be no hope
whatever in attempting the filling of a sieve. And if what
is poured into the Sustentation Fund is to be permitted,
instead of rising in the dividend, to dribble out incontinently
in a feeble extension, it will be all too soon discovered
that what we have to deal with is not the tun, but
the sieve; and the laity, losing all heart, will cease their
exertions, and permit their ministers to sink into poverty
and <i>fine-bodyism</i>.</p>

<a name='ORGANSHIP' id='ORGANSHIP'></a>
<h2>ORGANSHIP.</h2>
</div>
<p>Some six or eight months after the Disruption there occurred
an amusing dispute between two Edinburgh newspapers,
each of which aspired to represent the Establishment solely
and exclusively, without coadjutor or rival. The one paper
asserted that it was the <i>vehicle</i> of the Established Church,
the other that it was the Church&#8217;s <i>organ</i>; and each, in
asserting its own claim, challenged that of its neighbour.
The organ was sure that the vehicle lacked the true vehicular
character; and the vehicle threw grave doubts on the
organship of the organ. In somewhat less than half a year,
however, the dispute came suddenly to a close: the vehicle&ndash;&ndash;like
a luckless opposition coach, weak in its proprietorship&ndash;&ndash;was
run off the road, and broke down; and the
triumphant organ, seizing eager hold of the name of its
defunct rival as legitimate spoil, hung it up immediately
under its own, as a red warrior of the West seizes hold of
the scalp of a fallen enemy, and suspends it at his middle
by his belt of wampum. The controversy, however, lasted
quite long enough to lead curious minds to inquire how or
on what principle a body so divided as the Established
Church could possibly have either vehicle or organ.</p>
<p>If the organ, it was said, adequately represent Dr. Muir,
it cannot fail very grievously to misrepresent Dr. Bryce;
and if the vehicle be adapted to give public airings to the
thoughts and opinions of the bluff old Moderates, those of
Dr. Leishman and the Forty must travel out into the wind
and the sunlight by an opposition conveyance. One organ
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
or one vehicle will be no more competent to serve a deliberative
ecclesiastical body, diverse in its components, than
one organ or vehicle will be able to serve a deliberative
political body broken into factions. Single parties, as such&ndash;&ndash;whether
secular or ecclesiastical&ndash;&ndash;may have their single
organ apiece; but it seems as little possible that a Presbyterian
General Assembly should have only one organ representative
of the whole, as that a <i>House of Lords</i> or a <i>House
of Commons</i> should have one organ representative of the
whole. An organ of the Establishment in its present state
of disunion, if at all adequately representative, could not
fail to resemble Montgomery&#8217;s strange personification of
war: &#8216;A deformed genius, with two heads, which, unlike
those of Janus, were placed front to front; innumerable
arms, branching out all around his shoulders, sides, and
chest; and with thighs and legs as multitudinous as his
arms. His twin faces,&#8217; continues the poet, &#8216;were frightfully
distorted: they glared, they grinned, they spat, they railed,
and hissed, and roared; they gnashed their teeth, and bit,
and butted with their foreheads at each other; his arms,
wielding swords and spears, were fighting pell-mell together;
his legs, in like manner, were indefatigably at variance,
striding contrary ways, and trampling on each other&#8217;s toes,
or kicking each other&#8217;s shins, as if by mutual consent.&#8217;
Such would be the true representative of an organ that
adequately represented the Establishment.</p>
<p>We are led into this vein on the present occasion by a
recent discussion in high quarters on the organship of the
Free Church,&ndash;&ndash;a Presbyterian body, be it remarked, as
purely deliberative in its courts as the Parliament of the
country, and at least sufficiently affected by the spirit of the
age to include within its pale a considerable diversity of
opinion. It is as impossible, from this cause alone, that
the Free Church should be represented by a single organ,
as that the <i>House of Commons</i> should be represented by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
single organ. The organ, for instance, that represented
on the education question the Rev. Mr. Moody Stuart,
would most miserably misrepresent the party who advocate
the views of the great father of the Free Church&ndash;&ndash;the late
Dr. Chalmers.</p>
<p>The organ that represented the peculiar beliefs held, regarding
the personal advent, by the party to which Mr.
Bonar of Kelso belongs, would greatly misrepresent those
of the party to which Mr. David Brown of Glasgow and
Mr. Fairbairn of Saltoun belong. The organ that advocated
Dr. Cunningham&#8217;s and Dr. James Buchanan&#8217;s views
of the College question, would be diametrically opposed to
the view of Dr. Brown of Aberdeen and Mr. Gray of Perth.
The organ that contended for an ecclesiastical right to legislate
on the temporalities according to the principle of Mr.
Hay of Whiterig, would provoke the determined opposition
of Mr. Makgill Crichton of Rankeillour. The organ
that took part with the Evangelical and Sabbath Alliances
in the spirit of Dr. Candlish of St. George&#8217;s, would have to
defend its position against Mr. King of St. Stephen&#8217;s of the
Barony; and the organ that espoused the sentiments held
on tests by Mr. Wood of Elie, would find itself in hostile
antagonism with those entertained on the same subject by
Mr. Gibson of Kingston. And such are only a few of the
questions, and these of an ecclesiastical or semi-ecclesiastical
character, regarding which a diversity of views,
sentiments, and opinions in the Free Church renders it
impossible that it can be adequately represented by any
one organ, even should that organ be of a purely ecclesiastical
character. But a newspaper is <i>not</i> of a purely ecclesiastical
character; and there are subjects on which it may
represent a vast majority of the people of a Church, without
in the least degree representing the Church itself, simply
because they are subjects on which a Church, as such, can
hold no opinions whatever.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>It is, for instance, not for a Church to say in what degree
she trusts the Whigs or suspects the Tories&ndash;&ndash;or whether
her suspicion be great and her trust small&ndash;&ndash;or whether she
deem it more desirable that Edinburgh should be represented
by Mr. Cowan, than mis-represented by Mr. Macaulay.
These, and all cognate matters, are matters on
which the Church, as such, has no voice, and regarding
which she can therefore have no organ; and yet these are
matters with which a newspaper is necessitated to deal. It
would be other than a newspaper if it did not. On these
questions, however, which lie so palpably beyond the ecclesiastical
pale, though the Church can have no organ, zealous
Churchmen may; and there can be no doubt whatever that
they are questions on which zealous Free Churchmen <i>are</i>
very thoroughly divided&ndash;&ndash;so thoroughly, that any single
newspaper could represent, in reference to them, only one
class. The late Mr. John Hamilton, for instance&ndash;&ndash;a good
and honest man, who, in his character as a Free Churchman,
determinedly opposed the return of Mr. Macaulay&ndash;&ndash;was
wholly at issue regarding some of these points with the
Honourable Mr. Fox Maule, who in 1846 mounted the
hustings to say that the &#8216;gratitude and honour of the Free
Church&#8217; was involved in Mr. Macaulay&#8217;s return. And so
the organ that represented the one, could not fail to misrepresent
the other. Now, we are aware that on this, and
on a few other occasions, the <i>Witness</i> must have given very
considerable dissatisfaction in the political department to
certain members of the Free Church. It was not at all
their organ on these occasions; nay, at the very outset of
its career, it had solemnly pledged itself <i>not</i> to be their
organ.</p>
<p>The following passage was written by its present Editor,
ere the first appearance of his paper, and formed a part of
its prospectus:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;The <i>Witness</i>,&#8217; he said, &#8216;<i>will not espouse
the cause of any of the political parties which now agitate and</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
<i>divide the country</i>.&#8217; &#8216;Public measures, however, will be
weighed as they present themselves in an impartial spirit,
with care proportioned to their importance, and with reference
not to the party with which they may chance to
originate, but to the principles which they shall be found
to involve.&#8217; Such was the pledge given by the Editor of
the <i>Witness</i>; and he now challenges his readers to say
whether he has not honestly redeemed it. Man is naturally
a tool-making animal; and when he becomes a politician
by profession, his ingenuity in this special walk of constructiveness
is, we find, always greatly sharpened by the
exigencies of his vocation.</p>
<p>He makes tools of bishops, tools of sacraments, tools of
Confessions of Faith, and tools of Churches and church
livings.</p>
<p>We had just seen, previous to the <i>d&eacute;but</i> of the <i>Witness</i>,
the Church of Scotland converted by Conservatism into a
sort of mining tool, half lever, half pickaxe, which it plied
hard, with an eye to the prostration and ejection of its
political opponents the Whigs, then in office; and not
much pleased to see the Church which we loved and
respected so transmuted and so wielded, we solemnly determined
that, so far at least as our modicum of influence
extended, no tool-making politician, whatever his position,
should again convert it unchallenged into an ignoble party
utensil. With God&#8217;s help, we have remained true to our
determination; and so assured are we of being supported
in this matter by the sound-hearted Presbyterian people of
the Free Church, that we have no fear whatever, should
either the assertors among us of the unimpeachable consistency
of the Conservatives, or of the immaculate honesty
of the Whigs, start against us an opposition vehicle to-morrow,
that in less than a twelvemonth we would run it
fairly off the road, and have some little amusement with it
to boot, so long as the contest continued. The <i>Witness</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
is not, and, as we have shown, cannot be, the organ of
the Free Church; but it is something greatly better: it is
the trusted representative&ndash;&ndash;against Whig, Tory, Radical,
and Chartist&ndash;&ndash;against Erastian encroachment and clerical
domination&ndash;&ndash;of the Free Church people. There lies its
strength,&ndash;&ndash;a strength which its political Free Church opponents
are welcome to test when they please.</p>
<p>We must again express our regret that the article on the
Duke of Buccleuch, which has proved the occasion of so
much remark, spoken and written, should have ever appeared
in our columns; and this, not, as the agent of the Duke
asserts, because it has been <i>exposed</i>, but because of the
unhappy unsolidity of its facts, and because of that diversion
of the public attention which it has effected from cases such
as those of Canobie and Wanlockhead, and from such a
death-bed as that of the Rev. Mr. Innes. Our readers are
already in possession of our explanation, and have seen it
fully borne out by the incidental statement of Mr. Parker.
We would crave leave to remind them that the <i>Witness</i> is
now in the ninth year of its existence; and that during that
time the Editor stated many facts, from his own observation,
connected with the refusal of sites, and other matters of a
similar character. He saw congregations worshipping on
bare hill-sides in the Highlands of Sutherland, and on an
oozy sea-beach on the coast of Lochiel; he sailed in the
Free Church yacht the <i>Betsey</i>, and worshipped among the
islanders of Eigg and of Skye. Nor did he shrink from
very minutely describing what he had witnessed on these
occasions, nor yet from denouncing the persecution that had
thrust out some of the best men and best subjects of the
country, to worship unsheltered amid bleak and desert
wastes, or on the bare sea-shore.</p>
<p>And yet, of all the many facts which he thus communicated
on his own authority, because resting on his own observation,
not one of them has ever yet been disproved; nay,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
scarce one of them has ever yet been so much as challenged.</p>
<p>Of course, in reference to the statements which he has
had to make on the testimony of others, his position was
necessarily different; and a very delicate matter he has
sometimes found it to be, to deal with these statements. A
desire, on the one hand, to expose to the wholesome breathings
of public opinion whatever was really oppressive and
unjust; a fear, on the other, lest he should compromise the
general cause, or injure the character of his paper, by giving
publicity to what either might not be true, or could not be
proven to be true,&ndash;&ndash;have often led him to retain communications
beside him for weeks and months, until some circumstance
occurred that enabled him to determine regarding
their real character and value. And such&ndash;&ndash;with more, however,
than the ordinary misgivings, and with an unfavourable
opinion frankly and decidedly expressed&ndash;&ndash;was the course
which he took with the communicated article on the Duke
of Buccleuch.</p>
<p>That the testing circumstance which <i>did</i> occur in the
course of the long period during which it was thus held <i>in
retentis</i> was not communicated to him, or to any other
official connected with the <i>Witness</i>, he much regrets, but
could not possibly help.</p>
<p>In the discussion on the Sites Bill of Wednesday last, the
Honourable Fox Maule is made to say, that &#8216;the <i>Witness</i>
contained many articles which had been condemned by the
Church.&#8217;</p>
<p>Now this must be surely a misreport, as nothing could
be more grossly incorrect than such a statement. The
voice of the Free Church&ndash;&ndash;that by which she condemns or
approves&ndash;&ndash;can be emitted through but her deliberative
courts, and recorded in but the decisions of her solemn
Assemblies. On the merits or demerits of the <i>Witness</i>,
through these her only legitimate organs, she has not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
yet spoken; and Mr. Maule is, we are sure, by far too intelligent
a Churchman to mistake the voice of a mere political
coterie, irritated mayhap by the loss of an election, for the
solemn deliverance of a Church of Christ. With respect to
his reported statement, to the effect that the <i>Witness</i> &#8216;contained
many articles which had done great harm to the Free
Church,&#8217; the report may, we think, be quite correct. The
<i>Witness</i> contained a good many articles on the special
occasion when the Free Churchmen of Edinburgh conspired&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;ungratefully
and dishonourably,&#8217; as Mr. Maule
must have deemed it&ndash;&ndash;to eject a Whig Minister, and to
place in his seat, as their representative, a shrewd citizen
and honest man.</p>
<p>And these lucubrations accomplished, we daresay, their
modicum of harm. With regard, however, to the articles of
the <i>Witness</i> in general, we think we can confidently appeal
in their behalf to such of our readers as perused them, not
as they were garbled, misquoted, interpolated, and mis-represented
by unscrupulous enemies, but as they were first
given to the public from the pen of the Editor. Among
these readers we reckon men of all classes, from the peer
to the peasant&ndash;&ndash;Conservative landowners, magistrates, merchants,
ministers of the gospel. Dr. Chalmers was a reader
of the <i>Witness</i> from its first commencement to his death;
and he, perusing its editorial articles as they were originally
written&ndash;&ndash;not as they were garbled or interpolated in other
prints&ndash;&ndash;saw in them very little to blame.</p>
<p>Not but that some of our sentences look sufficiently
formidable in extracts when twisted from their original
meaning; and this, just as the Decalogue itself might be
instanced as a code of licentiousness, violence, and immorality,
were it to be exhibited in garbled quotations,
divested of all the <i>nots</i>. In the <i>Edinburgh Advertiser</i> of
yesterday, for instance, we find the following passage:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;It
[<i>The Witness</i>] has menaced our nobles with the horrors of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
the French Revolution, when the guillotine plied its nightly
task, and when the &#8220;bloody hearts of aristocrats dangled on
button-holes in the streets of Paris.&#8221; It has reminded them
of the time when a &#8220;grey discrowned head sounded hollow
on the scaffold at Whitehall;&#8221; insinuating that, if they persisted
in opposing the claims of the Free Church, a like
fate might overtake the reigning dynasty of our time.&#8217;</p>
<p>When, asks the reader, did these most atrocious threats
appear in the <i>Witness</i>?</p>
<p>They never, we reply, appeared in the <i>Witness</i> as threats at
all. The one passage, almost in the language of Chateaubriand,
was employed in an article in which we justified the
sentence pronounced on the atheist Patterson. The other
formed part of a purely historic reference&ndash;&ndash;in an article on
Puseyism, written ere the Free Church had any existence&ndash;&ndash;to
the Canterburianism of the times of Charles I., and the
fate of that unhappy monarch. We thought not of threatening
the aristocracy when quoting the one passage, nor yet
of foreboding evil to the existing dynasty when writing the
other. On exactly the same principle on which these
passages have been instanced to our disadvantage, the
description of the <i>Holoptychius Nobilissimus</i>, which appeared
a few years ago in the <i>Witness</i>, might be paraded as a
personal attack on Sir James Graham; and the remarks on
the construction of the <i>Pterichthys</i>, as a gross libel on the
Duke of Buccleuch. It is, we hold, not a little to the credit
of the <i>Witness</i>, that, in order to blacken its character,
means should be resorted to of a character so disreputable
and dishonest. From truth and fair statement it has all to
hope, and nothing to fear.</p>

<h2>BAILLIE&#8217;S LETTERS AND JOURNALS.</h2>
</div>
<p>This is at once the handsomest and one of the best editions
of the curious and very interesting class of works to which
it belongs, that has yet been given to the public. It is
scarce possible to appreciate too highly the tact, judgment,
and research displayed by the editor; and rarely indeed,
so far as externals are concerned, has the typography of
Scotland appeared to better advantage. It is a book
decked out for the drawing-room in a suit of the newest
pattern,&ndash;&ndash;a tall, modish, well-built book, that has to be
fairly set a-talking ere we discover from its tongue and style
that it is a production not of our own times, but of the
times of Charles and the Commonwealth. The good,
simple minister of Kilwinning would fail to recognise himself
in its fair open pages, that more than rival those of his
old <i>Elzevirs</i>. For his old-fashioned suit of home-spun
grey, we find him sporting here a modern dress-coat of
Saxony broadcloth, and a pair of unexceptionable cashmere
trousers; and it is not until we step forward and address
the worthy man, and he turns upon us his broad, honest
face, that we see the grizzled moustache and peaked beard,
and discover that his fears are still actively engaged regarding
the prelatic leanings of Charles <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>II.</span>, &#8216;now at Breda;&#8217;
though perchance not quite without hope that the counsel
of the &#8216;wise and godly youth&#8217; James Sharpe may have the
effect of setting all right again in the royal mind. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
address what we take, from the garb, to be a contemporary,
and find that we have stumbled on one of the seven
sleepers.</p>
<p>We deem it no slight advantage to the reading public of
the present day, that it should have works of this character
made so easy of access. It is only a very few years since
the student of Scottish ecclesiastical history could not
have acquainted himself with the materials on which the
historian can alone build, without passing through a course
of study at least as prolonged as an ordinary college course,
and much more laborious. Let us suppose that he lived
in some of the provinces. He would have, in the first
place, to come and reside in Edinburgh, and get introduced,
at no slight expense of trouble, mayhap, to the
brown, half-defaced manuscripts of our public libraries.
He would require next to study the old hand, with all its
baffling contractions. If he succeeded in mastering the
difficulties of Melville&#8217;s <i>Diary</i> after a quarter of a year&#8217;s
hard conning, he might well consider himself a lucky man.
Row&#8217;s <i>History</i> would occupy him during at least another
quarter; Baillie&#8217;s <i>Letters and Journals</i> would prove work
enough for two quarters more. If he succeeded in getting
access to the papers of Woodrow, he would find little less
than a twelvemonth&#8217;s hard labour before him; Calderwood&#8217;s
large <i>History</i> would furnish employment for at least
half that time; and if curious to peruse it in its best and
fullest form, he would find it necessary to quit Edinburgh
for London, to pore there over the large manuscript copy
stored up in the British Museum. As he proceeded in his
course, he would be continually puzzled by references,
allusions, initials; he would have to consult register offices,
records of baptisms and deaths, session books, old and
scarce works, hardly less difficult to be procured than even
the manuscripts themselves; and if he at length escaped
the fate of the luckless antiquary, who produced the famous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
history of the village of Wheatfield, he might deem himself
more than ordinarily fortunate. &#8216;When I first engaged in
this work,&#8217; said the poor man, &#8216;I had eyes of my own; but
now I cannot see even with the assistance of art: I have
gone from spectacles of the first sight to spectacles of the
third; the Chevalier Taylor gives my eyes over, and my
optician writes me word he can grind no higher for me.&#8217;
It will soon be no such Herculean task to penetrate to the
foundations of our national ecclesiastical history. From
publications such as those of the Woodrow Club, and of
the <i>Letters and Journals</i>, the student will be able to acquire
in a few weeks what would have otherwise cost him the
painful labour of years. Nor can we point out a more
instructive course of reading. In running over our modern
histories, however able, we almost always find our point of
view fixed down by the historian to the point occupied by
himself. We cannot take up another on our own behalf,
unless we differ from him altogether, nor select for ourselves
the various subjects which we are to survey. We
are in leading-strings for the time: the vigour of our
author&#8217;s thinking militates against the exercise of our own;
his philosophy enters our minds in a too perfect form,
and lies inert there, just as the condensed extract of some
nourishing food often fails to nourish at all, because it
gives no employment to the digestive faculty. A survey
of the historian&#8217;s materials has often, on the contrary, the
effect of setting the mind free. We see the events of the
times which he describes in their own light, and simply as
events,&ndash;&ndash;we select and arrange for ourselves,&ndash;&ndash;they call
up novel traits of character,&ndash;&ndash;they lead us to draw on our
experience of men,&ndash;&ndash;they confirm principles,&ndash;&ndash;they suggest
reflections.</p>
<p>Some of our readers will perhaps remember that we
noticed at considerable length the two first volumes of this
beautiful edition of Baillie rather more than a twelvemonth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
ago. The third and concluding volume has but lately
appeared. It embraces a singularly important period,&ndash;&ndash;extending
from shortly before the rise of the unhappy and
ultimately fatal quarrel between the Resolutioners and
Protesters, till the re-establishment of Episcopacy at the
Restoration, when the curtain closes suddenly over the
poor chronicler, evidently sinking into the grave at the
time, the victim of a broken heart. He sees a stormy
night settling dark over the Church,&ndash;&ndash;Presbytery pulled
down, the bishops set up, persecution already commenced;
and, longing to be released from his troubles, he affectingly
assures his correspondent, in the last of his many letters,
that &#8216;it was the matter of his daily grief that had brought
his bodily trouble upon him,&#8217; and that it would be &#8216;a favour
to him to be gone.&#8217; From a very learned, concise, and
well-written Life, the production of the accomplished editor,
which serves as a clue to guide the reader through the
mazes of the correspondence, we learn that he died three
months after.</p>
<p>Where there is so much that is interesting, one finds it
difficult to select. The light in which the infamous Sharpe
is presented in this volume is at least curious. Prelacy,
careful of the reputation of her archbishops, makes a great
deal indeed of the bloody death of the man, but says as
little as possible regarding his life and character. The
sentimental Jacobitism of the present day&ndash;&ndash;an imaginative
principle that feeds on novels, and admires the persecutors
because Claverhouse was brave and had an elegant upper
lip&ndash;&ndash;goes a little further, and speaks of him as the venerable
Archbishop. When the famous picture of his assassination
was exhibiting in Edinburgh, some ten or twelve
years ago, he rose with the class almost to the dignity of
a martyr: there were young ladies that could scarce look
at the piece without using their handkerchiefs; the victim
was old, greyhaired, reverend, an archbishop, and eminently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
saintly, as a matter of course, whatever the barbarous
fanatics might say; and all that his figure seemed
to want in order to make it complete, was just a halo of
yellow ochre round the head. In Baillie&#8217;s <i>Letters</i> we see him
exhibited, though all unwittingly on the part of the writer, in
his true character, and find that the yellow ochre would be
considerably out of place. Rarely, indeed, does nature, all
lost and fallen as it is, produce so consummate a scoundrel.
Treachery seems to have existed as so uncontrollable an
instinct in the man, that, like the appropriating faculty of
the thief, who amused himself by picking the pocket of the
clergyman who conducted him to the scaffold, it seems to
have been incapable of lying still. He appears never to
have had a friend who did not learn to detest and denounce
him: his Presbyterian friends, whom he deceived and betrayed,
did so in the first instance; his Episcopalian friends,
whom he at least strove to deceive and betray, did so in the
second. We are assured by Burnet, that even Charles, a
monarch certainly not over-nice in the moral sense, declared
James Sharpe to be one of the worst of men. His life was
a continuous lie; and he has left more proofs of the fact in
the form of letters under his own hand, than perhaps any
other bad man that ever lived.</p>
<p>In Baillie he makes his first appearance as the Presbyterian
minister of Crail, and as one of the honest chronicler&#8217;s
greatest favourites. The unhappy disputes between the Resolutioners
and Protesters were running high at the time.
Baillie was a Resolutioner, Sharpe a zealous Resolutioner
too; and Baillie, naturally unsuspicious, and biassed in his
behalf by that spirit of party which can darken the judgment
of even the most discerning, seems to have regarded
him as peculiarly the hope of the Church. He was indisputably
one of its most dexterous negotiators; and no man
of the age made a higher profession of religion. Burnet,
who knew him well in his after character as Archbishop of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
St. Andrews, tells us that never, save on one solitary occasion,
did he hear him make the slightest allusion to religion.
But in his letters to Baillie, almost every paragraph
closes with the aspirations of a well-simulated devotion.
They seem as if strewed over with the fragments of broken
doxologies. The old man was, as we have said, thoroughly
deceived. He assures his continental correspondent, Spang,
that &#8216;the great instrument of God to cross the evil designs
of the Protesters, was that <i>very worthy, pious, wise, and diligent
young man</i>, Mr. James Sharpe.&#8217; In some of his after
epistles we learn that he remembered him in his prayers,
no doubt very sincerely, as, under God, one of the mainstays
of the Church. What first strikes the reader in the
character of Sharpe, as here exhibited, is his exclusively
diplomatic cast of talent. Baillie himself was a controversialist: he
wrote books to influence opinion, and delivered
argumentative speeches. He was a man of business too:
he drew up remonstrances, petitions, protests, and carried
on the war of his party above-board. All his better friends
and correspondents, such as Douglas and Dickson, were
persons of a resembling cast. But Sharpe&#8217;s vocation lay in
dealing with men in closets and window recesses: he could
do nothing until he had procured the private ear of the
individual on whom he wished to act. Is he desirous to
influence the decisions of the Supreme Civil Court in behalf
of his party? He straightway ingratiates himself with
President Broghill, and the court becomes more favourable
in consequence. Is he wishful to propitiate the English
Government? He goes up to London, gets closeted with
its more influential members. It was this peculiar talent
that pointed him out to the Church as so fit a person to
treat with Charles at Breda.</p>
<p>And it is when employed in this mission that we begin
truly to see the man, and to discover the sort of ability on
which the success of his closetings depended. We find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
Baillie holding, in his simplicity, that in order to draw the
heart of the King from Episcopacy, nothing more could
be necessary than just fairly to submit to him some sound
controversial work, arranged on the plan of the good man&#8217;s
own <i>Ladensium</i>; and urging on Sharpe, that a few able
divines should be employed in getting up a compilation for
the express purpose. Sharpe writes in return, in a style
sufficiently quiet, that His Majesty, in his very first address,
&#8216;has been pleased to ask very graciously about Robert
Baillie,&#8217; a person for whom he has a particular kindness,
and whom, if favours were dealing, he would be sure not to
forget. He adds, further, that however matters might turn
out in England, the Presbyterian Establishment of Scotland
was in no danger of violation; and lest his Scotch friends
should fall into the error of thinking too much about other
men&#8217;s business, he gives fervent expression to the hope
&#8216;that the Lord would give them to prize their own mercies,
and know their own duties.&#8217; Even a twelvemonth after,
when on the eve of setting out for London to be created
a bishop, he writes his old friend, that whatever &#8216;occasion
of jealousies and false surmises his journey might give,&#8217;
of one thing he might be assured, &#8216;it was not in order
to a change in the Church,&#8217; as he &#8216;would convince his dear
friend Mr. Baillie, through the Lord&#8217;s help, when the Lord
would return him.&#8217; He has an under-plot of treachery
carrying on at the same time, that affects his &#8216;dear friend&#8217;
personally. In one of his letters to the unsuspecting
chronicler, he assures him that he was &#8216;doing his best, by
the Lord&#8217;s help,&#8217; to get him appointed Principal of the
University of Glasgow. In one of his letters to Lauderdale,
after stating that the office, &#8216;in the opinion of many,&#8217;
would require a man &#8216;of more acrimony and weight&#8217; than
&#8216;honest Baillie,&#8217; he urges that the presentation should be
sent him, with a blank space, in which the name of the
presentee might be afterwards inserted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>Baillie, naturally slow to suspect, does not come fully to
understand the character of the man until a very few months
before his death. He then complains bitterly to his continental
correspondent, amid the ruin of the Church, and from
the gloom of his sick-chamber, that Sharpe was the traitor
who, &#8216;piece by piece, had so cunningly trepanned them,
that the cause had been suffered to sink without even a
struggle.&#8217; The apostate had gained his object, however,
and become &#8216;His Grace the Lord Primate.&#8217; There were
great rejoicings. &#8216;The new bishops were magnificklie received;&#8217;
they were feasted by the Lord Commissioner&#8217;s
lady on one night, by the Chancellor on another; and in
especial, &#8216;the Archbishop had bought a new coach at
London, at the sides whereof two lakqueys in purple did
run.&#8217;</p>
<p>The vanity of Sharpe is well brought out on another
occasion by Burnet. The main object of one of his journeys
to London, undertaken a little more than a twelvemonth
after the death of Baillie, was to urge on the King
that, as Primate of Scotland, he should of right take precedence
of the Scottish Lord Chancellor, and to crave His
Majesty&#8217;s letter to that effect. In this trait, as in several
others, he seems to have resembled Robespierre. His
cruelty to his old friends the Presbyterians is well illustrated
by the fact that he could make the comparative
leniency of Lauderdale, apostate and persecutor as Lauderdale
was, the subject of an accusation against him to
Charles. But there is no lack of still directer instances in
the biographies of the worthies whom his malice pursued.
His meanness, too, seems to have been equal to his malice
and pride. When Lauderdale on one occasion turned
fiercely upon him, and threatened to impeach him for
<i>leasing-making</i>, he &#8216;straightway fell a-trembling and weeping,&#8217;
and, to avoid the danger, submitted to appear in the
royal presence; and there, in the coarsest terms, to confess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
himself a liar. It is a bishop who tells the story, and it is
only one of a series. Truly the Primate of all Scotland
was fortunate in the death he died. &#8216;The dismal end of
this unhappy man,&#8217; says Burnet, &#8216;struck all people with
horror, and softened his enemies into some tenderness; so
that his memory was treated with decency by those who
had very little respect for him during his life.&#8217;</p>
<p>In almost every page in this instructive volume the
reader picks up pieces of curious information, or finds
matters suggestive of interesting thought. There start up
ever and anon valuable hints that germinate and bear fruit
in the mind. We would instance, by way of illustration, a
hint which occurs in a letter to Lauderdale, written shortly
after the Restoration, and which, though apparently slight,
leads legitimately into a not unimportant train of thinking.
Scotchmen are much in the habit of referring to the political
maxim that the king can do no wrong, as a fundamental
principle of the constitution, which concerns them as
directly as it does their neighbours the English. Dr. Chalmers
alluded to it no later than last week, in his admirable
speech in the Commission. The old maxim, that the king
could do no wrong, he said, had now, it would seem, descended
from the throne to the level of courts co-ordinate
with the Church. Would it not be a somewhat curious
matter to find that this doctrine is one which has in reality
not entered Scotland at all? It stands in England, a
guardian in front of the throne, transferring every blow
which would otherwise fall on the sovereign himself, to the
sovereign&#8217;s ministers: it is ministers, not sovereigns, who
are responsible to the people of England. But it would at
least seem, that with regard to the people of Scotland the
responsibility extends further. At least the English doctrine
was regarded as <i>exclusively</i> an English one in the days
of Baillie, nearly half a century prior to the Union, and
more than a whole century ahead of those times in which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
the influence of that event began to have the effect of
mixing up in men&#8217;s minds matters peculiar to England
with matters common to Britain. We find Baillie, in his
letter written immediately after the passing of the Act
Recissory, pronouncing the doctrine that the &#8216;king can do
no fault,&#8217; as in his judgment &#8216;good and wise,&#8217; but referring
to it at the same time as a doctrine, not of the Scottish
Constitution, but of the &#8216;State of England.&#8217;</p>
<p>The circumstance is of importance chiefly from the light
which it serves to cast on an interesting passage in Scottish
history. The famous declaration of our Scotch Convention
at the Revolution, that James <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>VII.</span> had <i>forfeited</i> the throne,
as contrasted with the singularly inadequate though virtually
corresponding declaration of the English Convention, that
James <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>II.</span> &#8216;had <i>abdicated</i> the government, and that the
throne was thereby vacant,&#8217; has been often remarked by
the historians. Hume indirectly accounts for the employment
of the stronger word, by prominently stating that the
more zealous among the Scotch Royalists, regarding the
assembly as illegal, had forborne to appear at elections,
and that the antagonist party commanded a preponderating
majority in consequence; whereas in England the Tories
mustered strong, and had to be conciliated by the employment
of softer language. Malcolm Laing, in noticing the
fact, contents himself by simply contrasting the indignation
on the part of the Scotch, which had been aroused by their
recent sufferings, with the quieter temper of the English,
who had been less tried by the pressure of actual persecution,
and who were anxious to impart to Revolution at
least the colour of legitimate succession. And Sir James
Mackintosh, in his <i>Vindici&aelig; Gallic&aelig;</i>, contents himself with
simply remarking that the &#8216;absurd debates in the English
Convention were better cut short by the Parliament of
Scotland, when they used the correct and manly expression
that James <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>VII.</span> <i>had forfeited the throne</i>.&#8217; We are of opinion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
that the very different styles of the two Conventions may
be accounted for on the ground that, in the one kingdom,
the monarch, according to the genius of the constitution,
was regarded as incapable of committing wrong; whereas,
in the other, he was no less constitutionally regarded as
equally peccable with any of his subjects. A peccable
monarch may <i>forfeit</i> his throne; an impeccable one can
only <i>abdicate</i> it. The argument must of course depend on
the soundness of Baillie&#8217;s statement. Was the doctrine
that the king can do no wrong a Scottish doctrine at the
time of the Revolution, or was it not?</p>
<p>It was at least not a Scottish one in the days of
Buchanan,&ndash;&ndash;nor for a century after, as we may learn
very conclusively, not from Buchanan himself, nor his
followers&ndash;&ndash;for the political doctrines of a school of
writers may be much at variance with those of their
country&ndash;&ndash;but from the many Scottish controversialists on
the antagonist side, who entered the lists against both
the master and his disciples. Buchanan maintained, in
his philosophical treatise, <i>De Jure Regni apud Scotos</i>, that
there are conditions by which the King of Scotland is
bound to his people, on the fulfilment of which the allegiance
of the people depends, and that &#8216;it is lawful to depose,
and even to punish tyrants.&#8217; Knox, with the other worthies
of the first Reformation, held exactly the same doctrine.
The <i>Lex Rex</i> of Rutherford testifies significantly to the fact
that among the worthies of the second Reformation it was
not suffered to become obsolete. It takes a prominent
place in writings of the later Covenanters, such as the
<i>Hind let Loose</i>; and at the Revolution it received the practical
concurrence of the National Convention, and of the
country generally. Now the doctrine, be it remembered,
was an often disputed one. Buchanan&#8217;s little work was the
very butt of controversy for considerably more than an
hundred years. It was prohibited by Parliament, denounced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
by monarchs, condemned to the flames by universities;
great lawyers wrote treatises against it at home,
and some of the most celebrated scholars of continental
Europe took the field against it abroad. We learn from
Dr. Irving, in his <i>Classical Biography</i>, that it was assailed
among our own countrymen by Blackwood, Winzet, Barclay,
Sir Thomas Craig, Sir John Wemyss, Sir Lewis
Stewart, Sir James Turner, and last, not least, among the
writers who preceded the Revolution, by the meanly
obsequious and bloody Sir George Mackenzie. And how
did these Scotchmen meet with the grand doctrine which
it embodied? The &#8216;old maxime of the state of England,&#8217;
had it extended to the sister kingdom, would have at once
furnished the materials of reply. If constitutionally the
King of Scotland could do no wrong, then <i>constitutionally</i>
the King of Scotland could not be deposed. But of an
entirely different complexion was the argument of which
the Scottish assailants of Buchanan availed themselves. It
was an argument subversive to the English maxim. Admitting
fully that the king <i>could</i> do wrong, they maintained
merely that, for whatever wrong he did, he was responsible,
not to his subjects, but to God only. Whatever the amount
of wrong he committed, it was the duty of his subjects, they
said, passively to submit to it. On came the Revolution.
In England, in perfect agreement with the doctrine of the
king&#8217;s impeccability&ndash;&ndash;in perfect agreement, at least, so far
as words were concerned&ndash;&ndash;it was declared that James had
abdicated the government, and that the throne was thereby
vacant; and certainly it cannot be alleged by even the
severest moralist, that in either abdicating a government or
vacating a throne, there is the slightest shadow of moral
evil involved. In Scotland the decision was different.
The battle fought in the Convention was exactly that which
had been previously fought between Buchanan and his
antagonists. &#8216;Paterson, Archbishop of Glasgow, and Sir
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
George Mackenzie, asserted,&#8217; says Malcolm Laing, &#8216;the
doctrine of divine right, or maintained, with more plausibility,
that every illegal measure of James&#8217;s government was
vindicated by the declaration of the late Parliament, that <i>he
was an absolute monarch, entitled to unreserved obedience</i>, <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>AND
ACCOUNTABLE TO NONE</span>; while Sir James Montgomery and
Sir John Dalrymple, who conducted the debate on the
other side, averred that the Parliament was neither competent
to grant, nor the king to acquire, <i>an absolute power,
irreconcilable with the</i> <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>RECIPROCAL OBLIGATIONS DUE TO
THE PEOPLE</span>.&#8217; The doctrines of Buchanan prevailed; and
the estates declared that James <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>VII.</span> having, through &#8216;<i>the
advice of evil and wicked councillors</i>, invaded the fundamental
constitution of the kingdom, and altered it from a legal
limited monarchy to an arbitrary despotic power,&#8217; he had
thereby <i>forfaulted</i> his right to the crown.&#8217; The terms of
the declaration demonstrate that Baillie was quite in the
right regarding the &#8216;old maxime, that the king can do no
fault,&#8217; as exclusively a &#8216;maxime of the State of England.&#8217;
By acting on the advice of &#8216;evil and wicked councillors,&#8217; it
was declared that a peccable king had forfeited the throne.
The fact that there were councillors in the case did not so
much even as extenuate the offence: it was the advisers of
the King who then, as now, were accountable to the King&#8217;s
English subjects for the advice they gave; it was the King
in person who was accountable to his Scottish subjects for
the advice he took. This principle, hitherto little adverted
to, throws, as we have said, much light on the history of the
Revolution in Scotland.</p>

<h2>FIRST PRINCIPLES.</h2>
</div>
<p>There is a passage in the <i>Life of Sir Matthew Hale</i> which
has struck us as not only interesting in itself, from the breadth
and rectitude of judgment which it discloses, but also from
the very direct bearing of the principle involved in it on
some of the recent interdicts of the Supreme Civil Court.
It serves to throw a kind of historic light, if we may so
speak, on the judicial talent of our country in the present
age as exhibited by the majority of our judges of the Court
of Session&ndash;&ndash;such a light as the ecclesiastical historian of a
century hence will be disposed to survey it in, when coolly
exercising his judgment on the present eventful struggle.
One of not the least prominent nor least remarkable
features of the Rebellion of 1745, says a shrewd chronicler
of this curious portion of our history, was an utter destitution
of military talent among the general officers of the
British army. And the time is in all probability not very
distant, in which the extreme lack of judicial genius betrayed
by our courts of law in their present collision with
the courts ecclesiastical, shall be regarded, in like manner,
as one of the more striking characteristics of the <i>Rebellion</i>
of the present day.</p>
<p>Sir Matthew Hale, as most of our readers must be aware,
was a devoted Royalist. He was rising in eminence as a
barrister at the time the Civil Wars broke out, and during
that troublesome period he was employed as counsel for
almost all the more eminent men of the King&#8217;s party who
were impeached by the Parliament. He was counsel for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
the Earl of Strafford, for Archbishop Laud, for the Duke of
Hamilton, for the Earl of Holland, and for Lords Capel
and Craven; and in every instance he exhibited courage
the most unshrinking and devoted, and abilities of the
highest order. When threatened in open court on one
occasion by the Attorney-General, he replied that the
threat might be spared: he was pleading in defence of
those laws which the Government had declared it would
maintain and preserve, and no fear of personal consequences
should deter him in such circumstances from doing
his duty to his client. When Charles himself was brought
to his trial, Sir Matthew came voluntarily forward, and
offered to plead for him also; but as the King declined
recognising the competency of his judges, the offer was of
course rejected. We all know how Malesherbes fared for
acting a similar part in France. The counsel of Louis
XVI. closed his honourable career on the scaffold not long
after his unfortunate master: his generous advocacy of
the devoted monarch cost him his life. But Cromwell,
that &#8216;least flagitious of all usurpers,&#8217; according to even
Clarendon&#8217;s estimate, was no Robespierre; and were we
called on to illustrate by a single instance from the history
of each the very opposite characters of the Puritan Republicans
of England and the Atheistical Republican of
France, we would just set off against one another the fate
of Malesherbes and the treatment of Sir Matthew. Cromwell,
unequalled in his ability of weighing the capabilities
of men, had been carefully scanning the course of the
courageous and honest barrister; and, convinced that so
able a lawyer and so good and brave a man could scarce
fail of making an excellent judge, he determined on raising
him to the bench. At this stage, however, a difficulty
interposed, not in the liberal and enlightened policy of
the Protector, who had no objections whatever to a conscientious
Royalist magistrate, but in the scruples of Sir
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
Matthew, who at first doubted the propriety of taking
office under what he deemed a usurped power.</p>
<p>The process of argument by which he overcame the difficulty,
simple as it may seem, is worthy of all heed. Its
very simplicity may be regarded as demonstrating the
soundness of the understanding that originated and then
acted upon it as a firm first principle, especially when we
take into account the exquisitely nice character of the conscience
which it had to satisfy. It is absolutely necessary
for the wellbeing of society, argued Sir Matthew, that justice
be administered between man and man; and the necessity
exists altogether independently of the great political
events which affect the sources of power, by changing
dynasties or revolutionizing governments. The claim of
the supreme ruler <i>de facto</i> may be a bad one; he may owe
his power to some act of great political injustice&ndash;&ndash;to an
iniquitous war&ndash;&ndash;to an indefensible revolution&ndash;&ndash;to a foul
conspiracy; but the flaw in his title cannot be regarded as
weakening in the least the claim of the people under him
to the administration of justice among them as the ordinance
of God. The <i>right</i> of the honest man to be protected
by the magistrate from the thief&ndash;&ndash;the right of the
peaceable man to be protected by the magistrate from the
assassin&ndash;&ndash;is not a conditional right, dependent on the title
of the ruler: it is as clear and certain during those periods
so common in history, when the supreme power is illegitimately
vested, as during the happier periods of undisputed
legitimacy. And to be a minister of God for the administration
of justice, if the office be attainable without sin, is
as certainly right at all times as the just exercise of the
magistrate&#8217;s functions is right at all times. If it be right
that society be protected by the magistrate, it is as unequivocally
right in the magistrate to protect. But it is
wrong to recognise as legitimate the supreme ruler of a
country if his power be palpably usurped. English society,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
under Cromwell, retains its right to have justice administered,
wholly unaffected by the flaw in Cromwell&#8217;s title;
but it would be wrong to recognise his title, contrary to
one&#8217;s conviction, as void of any flaw. In short, to use the
simple language of Burnet, Sir Matthew, &#8216;after mature deliberation,
came to be of opinion, that as it was absolutely
necessary to have justice and property kept up at all times,
it was no sin to take a commission from usurpers, if there
was declaration made of acknowledging their authority.&#8217;
Cromwell had breadth enough to demand no such declaration
from Sir Matthew, and so the latter took his place
on the bench. Nor is it necessary to say how he adorned
it. In agreement with his political views, he declined
taking any part in trials for offences against the State; but
in cases of ordinary felonies, no one could act with more
vigour and decision. During the trial of a Republican
soldier, who had waylaid and murdered a Royalist, the
colonel of the soldier came into court to arrest judgment,
on the plea that his man had done only his duty, for that
the person whom he had killed had been disobeying the
Protector&#8217;s orders at the time; and to threaten the judge
with the vengeance of the supreme authority, if he urged
matters to an extremity against him. Sir Matthew listened
coolly to his threats and his reasonings, and then, pronouncing
sentence of death against the felon, agreeably to
the finding of the jury, he ordered him out to instant execution,
lest the course of justice should be interrupted by
any interference on the part of Government. On another
occasion, in which he had to preside in a trial in which the
Protector was deeply concerned, he found that the jury
had been returned, not by the sheriff or his lawful officer,
but by order of the Protector himself. He immediately
dismissed them, and, refusing to go on with the trial, broke
up the court. Cromwell, says Burnet, was highly displeased
with him on this occasion, and on his return from the circuit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
in which it had occurred, told him in great anger that
&#8216;he was not fit to be a judge.&#8217; &#8216;Very true,&#8217; replied Sir
Matthew, whose ideas of the requirements of the office were
of the most exalted character,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Very true;&#8217; and so the
matter dropped.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is absolutely necessary,&#8217; argued Sir Matthew, &#8216;to
have justice kept up at all times,&#8217; whatever flaws may
exist in the title of the men in whom the supreme authority
may chance to be vested. Never yet was there a simpler
proposition; but there is sublimity in its breadth. It involves
the true doctrine of subjection to the magistrate, as
enforced by St. Paul. The New Testament furnishes us
with no disquisitions on political justice: it does not say
whether the title of Domitian to the supreme authority was
a good title or no, or whether he should have been succeeded
by Caligula, and Caligula by Claudius, or no; or
whether or no the fact that Claudius was poisoned by the
mother of Nero, derived to Nero any right to Claudius&#8217;s
throne. We hear nothing of these matters. The magistracy
described by St. Paul is the magistracy conceived of
by Sir Matthew Hale &#8216;as necessary to be kept up at all
times.&#8217; An application of this simple principle to some of
the more marked proceedings of our civil courts during
the last two years will be found an admirable means of
testing their degree of judicial wisdom. &#8216;It is absolutely
necessary to have justice kept up at all times,&#8217; and this not
less necessary surely within than beyond the pale of the
Church. It is necessary that a minister of the gospel &#8216;be
blameless&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;no drunkard, no swindler, no thief, no grossly
obscene person; nor can any supposed flaw in the constitution
of an ecclesiastical court disannul the necessity. A
man may sit in that court in a judicial capacity whose competency
to take his seat there may not have been determined
by some civil court that challenges for itself an
equivocal and disputed right to decide in the matter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
There may exist some supposed, or even some real, flaw
in that supreme ecclesiastical authority of the country,
through the exertion of which the Church is to be protected
from the infection of vice and irreligion; but this
flaw, real or supposed, furnishes no adequate cause why
justice in the Church &#8216;should not be kept up.&#8217; &#8216;Justice,&#8217;
said Sir Matthew, &#8216;must be kept up at all times,&#8217; whatever
the irregularities of title which may occur in the supreme
authority. The great society of the Church has a right to
justice, whether it be decided that the ministers of <i>quoad
sacra</i> parishes have what has been termed a <i>legal</i> right to
sit in ecclesiastical courts or no. The devout and honest
church member has a right to be protected from the blasphemous
profanities of the wretched minister who is a thief
or wretched swindler; the chaste and sober have a right to
be protected from the ministrations of the drunken and the
obscene wretch, whose preaching is but mockery, and his
dispensations of the sacrament sacrilege. The Church has
a right to purge itself of such ministers; and these sacred
rights no supposed, even no real, flaw in the constitution
of its courts ought to be permitted to affect. &#8216;Justice may
be kept up at all times.&#8217; We have said that the principle
of Sir Matthew Hale serves to throw a kind of historic
light on the judicial talent of our country in the present
age, as represented by the majority of our Lords of Session.
It enables us, in some sort, to anticipate regarding it the
decision of posterity. The list of cases of protection
afforded by the civil court will of itself form a curious
climax in the page of some future historian. Swindling
will come after drunkenness in the series, theft will follow
after swindling, and the miserable catalogue will be summed
up by an offence which we must not name. And it will be
remarked that all these gross crimes were fenced round and
protected in professed ministers of the gospel by the interference
of the civil courts, just because a majority of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
judges were men so defective in judicial genius that they
lost sight of the very first principles of their profession, and
held that &#8216;justice is <i>not</i> to be kept up at all times.&#8217; But
we leave our readers to follow up the subject. Some of the
principles to which we have referred may serve to throw
additional light on the remark of Lord Ivory, when recalling
the interdict in the Southend case. &#8216;Even were the
objection against the competency of <i>quoad sacra</i> ministers
to be ultimately sustained,&#8217; said his Lordship, &#8216;I am disposed
to hold that the judicial acts and sentences of the General
Assembly and its Commission, <i>bona fide</i> pronounced in the
interim, should be given effect to notwithstanding.&#8217;</p>

<h2>AN UNSPOKEN SPEECH.</h2>
</div>
<p>We enjoyed the honour on Wednesday last of being present
as a guest at the annual soiree of the Scottish Young Men&#8217;s
Society, and derived much pleasure from the general appearance
of the meeting, and the addresses of the members
and their friends. The body of the great Waterloo Room
was crowded on the occasion with a respectable, intellectual-looking
audience, including from about a hundred and fifty to
two hundred members of the Society, all of them young men
banded together for mutual improvement, and most of them
in that important decade of life&ndash;&ndash;by far the most important of
the appointed seven&ndash;&ndash;which intervenes between the fifteenth
and the five-and-twentieth year. The platform was equally
well filled, and the Sheriff of Edinburgh occupied the chair.
We felt a particular interest in the objects of the Society,
and a deep sympathy with its members; for, as we listened
to the various speakers, and our eyes glanced over the intelligent
countenances that thronged the area of the apartment,
we thought of past difficulties encountered in a cause
similar to that which formed the uniting bond of the Society,
and of not a few wrecks which we had witnessed of men
who had set out in life from the humbler levels, with the
determination of pressing their way upwards. And feeling
somewhat after the manner that an old sailor would feel
who saw a crew of young ones setting out to thread their
way through some dangerous strait, the perils of which he
had already encountered, or to sail round some formidable
cape, which, after many an unsuccessful attempt, he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
doubled, we fancied ourselves in the position of one qualified
to give them some little advice regarding the navigation
of the seas on which they were just entering. But, be the
fact of qualification as it may, we found ourselves, after
leaving the room, addressing them, in imagination, in a few
plain words, regarding some of the rocks, and shoals, and
insidious currents, which we knew lay in their course. Men
whose words come slowly and painfully when among their
fellows, can be quite fluent enough when they speak inwards
without breaking silence, and have merely an imaginary
assemblage for their audience; and so our short address
went off glibly, without break or interruption, in the style of
ordinary conversational gossip. There are curious precedents
on record for the printing of unspoken speeches.
Rejecting, however, all the higher ones, we shall be quite
content to take our precedent from the famous speech which
the &#8216;indigent philosopher&#8217; addresses, in one of Goldsmith&#8217;s
<i>Essays</i>, to Mr. Bellowsmender and the Cateaton Club. The
philosopher begins, it will be remembered, by telling his
imaginary audience, that though Nathan Ben Funk, the
rich Jew, might feel a natural interest in the state of the
stocks, it was nothing to them, who had no money; and
concludes by quoting the &#8216;famous author called Lilly&#8217;s
Grammar.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Members of the Scottish Young Men&#8217;s Society,&#8217; we
said, &#8216;it is rather late in life for the individual who now
addresses you to attempt acquiring the art of the public
speaker. Those who have been most in the habit of
noticing the effect of the several mechanical professions
on character and intellect, divide them into two classes&ndash;&ndash;the
<i>sedentary</i> and the <i>laborious</i>; and they remark, that
while in the <i>sedentary</i>, such as the printing, weaving, tailoring,
and shoemaking trades, there are usually a considerable
proportion of fluent speakers, in the <i>laborious</i> trades, on the
other hand, such as those of the mason, ship-carpenter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
ploughman, and blacksmith, one generally meets with but
taciturn, slow-speaking men. We need scarce say in which
of these schools we have been trained. You will at once
see&ndash;&ndash;to borrow from one of the best and most ancient of
writers&ndash;&ndash;that we are &#8220;not eloquent,&#8221; but &#8220;a man of slow
speech, and of a slow tongue.&#8221; And yet we think we may
venture addressing ourselves, in a few plain words, to an
association of young men united for the purpose of mutual
improvement. We ought and we do sympathize with you
in your object; and we congratulate you on the facilities
which your numbers, and your library, and your residence
in one of the most intellectual cities in the world, cannot
fail to afford you in its pursuit. We ourselves have known
what it is to prosecute in solitude, with but few books, and
encompassed by many difficulties, the search after knowledge;
and we have seen year after year pass by, and the
obstacles in our way remaining apparently as great as at
first. And were we to sum up the condensed result of our
experience in two brief words of advice, it would amount
simply to this, &#8220;Never despair.&#8221; We are told of Commodore
Anson&ndash;&ndash;a man whose sense and courage ultimately
triumphed over a series of perhaps the most appalling
disasters man ever encountered, and who won for himself,
by his magnanimity, sagacity, and cool resolution, the
applauses of even his enemies, so that Rousseau and
Voltaire eulogized him, the one in history, the other in
romance,&ndash;&ndash;we are told, we say, of this Anson, that when
raised to the British peerage, he was permitted to select his
own motto, and that he chose an eminently characteristic
one&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;<i>Nil Desperandum</i>.&#8221; By all means let it be your
motto also&ndash;&ndash;not as a thing to be paraded on some heraldic
label, but to be engraved upon your hearts. We wish that,
amid the elegancies of this hall, we could bring up before
you some of the scenes of our past life. They would
form a curious panorama, and might serve to teach that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
in no circumstances, however apparently desperate, should
men lose hope. Never forget that it is not necessary, in
order to overcome gigantic difficulties, that one&#8217;s strength
should be gigantic. Persevering exertion is much more
than strength. We owe to shovels and wheelbarrows, and
human muscles of the average size and vigour, the great
railway which connects the capitals of the two kingdoms.
And the difficulties which encompass the young man of
humble circumstances and imperfect education, must be
regarded as coming under the same category as difficulties
of the purely physical kind. Interrupted or insulated
efforts, however vigorous, will be found to be but of little
avail. It is to the element of continuity that you must
trust. There is a world of sense in Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s favourite
proverb, &#8220;<i>Time</i> and I, gentlemen, against any two.&#8221;
But though it be unnecessary, in order to secure success,
that one&#8217;s efforts in the contest with gigantic difficulties
should be themselves gigantic, it is essentially necessary
that they should employ one&#8217;s whole strength. Half efforts
never accomplish anything. &#8220;No man ever did anything
well,&#8221; says Johnson, &#8220;to which he did not apply the whole
bent of his mind.&#8221; And unless a man keep his head cool,
and his faculties undissipated, he need not expect that his
efforts can ever be other than half efforts, or other than of
a desultory, fitful, non-productive kind. We do not stand
here in the character of a modern Rechabite. But this we
must say: Let no young man ever beguile himself with the
hope that he is to make a figure in society, or rise in the
world, unless, as the apostle expresses it, he be &#8220;temperate
in all things.&#8221; Scotland has produced not a few distinguished
men who were unfortunately <i>not</i> temperate; but
it is well known that of one of the greatest of them all&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
one of the most vigorous-minded men our country
ever produced&ndash;&ndash;the intemperate habits were not formed
early. Robert Burns, up till his twenty-sixth year, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
he had mastered all his powers, and produced some of
his finest poems, was an eminently sober man. Climbing
requires not only a steady foot, but a strong head; and
we question whether any one ever climbed the perilous
steep, where, according to Beattie, &#8220;Fame&#8217;s proud temple
shines afar,&#8221; who did not keep his head cool during the
process. So far as our own experience goes, we can truly
state, that though we have known not a few working men,
possessed some of them of strong intellects, and some of
them of fine taste, and even of genius, not one have we
ever known who rose either to eminence or a competency
under early formed habits of intemperance. These indeed
are the difficulties that cannot be surmounted, and the
only ones. Rather more than thirty years ago, the drinking
usages of the country were more numerous than they are
now. In the mechanical profession in which we laboured
they were many: when a foundation was laid, the workmen
were treated to drink; they were treated to drink
when the walls were levelled; they were treated to drink
when the building was finished; they were treated to drink
when an apprentice joined the squad; treated to drink
when his apron was washed; treated to drink when his
&#8220;time was out;&#8221; and occasionally they learned to treat
one another to drink. At the first house upon which we
were engaged as a slim apprentice boy, the workmen had
a royal founding-pint, and two whole glasses of whisky
came to our share. A full-grown man might not deem a
gill of usquebhae an over-dose, but it was too much for a
boy unaccustomed to strong drink; and when the party
broke up, and we got home to our few books&ndash;&ndash;few, but
good, and which we had learned at even an earlier period
to pore over with delight&ndash;&ndash;we found, as we opened the
page of a favourite author, the letters dancing before our
eyes, and that we could no longer master his sense. The
state was perhaps a not very favourable one for forming a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
resolution in, but we believe the effort served to sober us.
We determined in that hour that never more would we
sacrifice our capacity of intellectual enjoyment to a drinking
usage; and during the fifteen years which we spent as
an operative mason, we held, through God&#8217;s help, by the
determination. We are not sure whether, save for that determination,
we would have had the honour of a place on
this platform to-night. But there are other kinds of intoxication
than that which it is the nature of strong drink or of
drugs to produce. Bacon speaks of a &#8220;natural drunkenness.&#8221;
And the hallucinations of this natural drunkenness
must be avoided if you would prosper. Let us specify one
of these. Never let yourselves be beguiled by the idea
that fate has misplaced you in life, and that were you in
some other sphere you would rise. It is true that some
men <i>are</i> greatly misplaced; but to brood over the idea is
not the best way of getting the necessary exchange effected.
It is not the way at all. Often the best policy in the case
is just to forget the misplacement. We remember once
deeming ourselves misplaced, when, in a season of bad
health and consequent despondency, we had to work
among labourers in a quarry. But the feeling soon passed,
and we set ourselves carefully to examine the quarry.
Cowper describes a prisoner of the Bastile beguiling his
weary hours by counting the nail-studs on the door of his
cell, upwards, downwards, and across,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8220;</span>Wearing out time in numbering to and fro,<br />

</div>
<p>It was idle work; for to reckon up the door-studs never so
often was not the way of opening up the door. But in carefully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
examining and recording for our own use the appearances
of the stony bars of our prison, we were greatly more
profitably employed. Nay, we had stumbled on one of the
best possible modes of escaping from our prison. We were
in reality getting hold of its bolts and its stancheons, and
converting them into tools in the work of breaking out.
We remember once passing a whole season in one of the
dreariest districts of the north-western Highlands,&ndash;&ndash;a district
included in that unhappy tract of country, doomed,
we fear, to poverty and suffering, which we find marked
in the rain-map of Europe with a double shade of blackness.
We had hard work, and often soaking rain, during
the day; and at night our damp fuel filled the turf hut in
which we sheltered with suffocating smoke, and afforded
no light by which to read. Nor&ndash;&ndash;even ere the year got
into its wane, and when in the long evenings we <i>had</i> light&ndash;&ndash;had
we any books to read by it, or a single literary or
scientific friend with whom to exchange an idea. We remember
at another time living in an agricultural district
in the low country, in a hovel that was open along the
ridge of the roof from gable to gable, so that as we lay
a-bed we could tell the hours of the night by the stars
that were passing overhead across the chasm. There were
about half-a-dozen farm-servants, victims to the bothie
system, that ate and slept in the same place; and often,
long after midnight, a disreputable poacher used to come
stealthily in, and fling himself down on a lair of straw that
he had prepared for himself in a corner. Now, both the
Highland hut and the Lowland hovel, with their accompaniments
of protracted and uncongenial labour, might be
regarded as dreary prisons; and yet we found them to be
in reality useful schools, very necessary to our education.
And now, when we hear about the state of the Highlands,
and the character of our poor Highlanders, and of the
influence of the bothie system and of the game-laws, we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
feel that we know considerably more about such matters
than if our experience had been of a more limited or more
pleasant kind. There are few such prisons in which a
young man of energy and a brave heart can be placed, in
which he will not gain more by taking kindly to his work,
and looking well about him, than by wasting himself in
convulsive endeavours to escape. If he but learn to think
of his prison as a school, there is good hope of his ultimately
getting out of it. Were a butcher&#8217;s boy to ask us&ndash;&ndash;you
will not deem the illustration too low, for you will
remember that Henry Kirke White was once a butcher&#8217;s
boy&ndash;&ndash;were he to ask us how we thought he could best
escape from his miserable employment, we would at once
say, You have rare opportunities of observation; you may
be a butcher&#8217;s boy in body, but in mind you may become
an adept in one of the profoundest of the sciences, that
of comparative anatomy;&ndash;&ndash;think of yourself as not in a
prison, but in a school, and there is no fear but you will
rise. There is another delusion of that &#8220;natural drunkenness&#8221;
referred to, against which you must also be warned.
Never sacrifice your independence to a phantom. We
have seen young men utterly ruin themselves through the
vain belief that they were too good for their work. They
were mostly lads of a literary turn, who had got a knack
of versifying, and who, in the fond belief that they were
poets and men of genius, and that poets and men of genius
should be above the soil and drudgery of mechanical labour,
gave up the profession by which they had lived, poorly
mayhap, but independently, and got none other to set in
its place. A mistake of this character is always a fatal
one; and we trust all of you will ever remember, that
though a man may think himself above his work, no man
<i>is</i>, or no man ought to think himself, above the high dignity
of being independent. In truth, he is but a sorry, weak
fellow who measures himself by the conventional status of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
the labour by which he lives. Our great poet formed a
correcter estimate:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8220;</span>What though on hamely fare we dine,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>Wear hodden grey, and a&#8217; that?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 1.5em;'>A man&#8217;s a man for a&#8217; that.&#8221;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>There is another advice which we would fain give you,
though it may be regarded as of a somewhat equivocal
kind: Rely upon yourselves. The man who sets his hopes
upon patronage, or the exertions of others in his behalf, is
never so respectable a man, and, save in very occasional
instances, rarely so <i>lucky</i> a man, as he who bends his exertions
to compel fortune in his behalf, by making himself
worthy of her favours. Some of the greatest wrecks we
have seen in life have been those of waiters on patronage;
and the greatest discontents which we have seen in corporations,
churches, and states, have arisen from the exercise
of patronage. Shakespeare tells us, in his exquisite vein,
of a virtue that is twice blessed,&ndash;&ndash;blessed in those who
give, and blessed in those who receive. Patronage is twice
cursed,&ndash;&ndash;cursed in the incompetency which it places where
merit ought to be, and in the incompetency which it creates
among the class who make it their trust. But the curse
which you have mainly to avoid is that which so often falls
on those who waste their time and suffer their energies to
evaporate in weakly and obsequiously waiting upon it. We
therefore say, Rely upon yourselves. But there is One other
on whom you must rely; and implicit reliance on Him,
instead of inducing weakness, infinitely increases strength.
Bacon has well said, that a dog is brave and generous
when he believes himself backed by his master, but timid
and crouching, especially in a strange place, when he is
alone and his master away. And a human master, says
the philosopher, is as a god to the dog. It certainly does
inspire a man with strength to believe that his great Master
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
is behind him, invigorating him in his struggles, and protecting
him against every danger. We knew in early life
a few smart infidels&ndash;&ndash;smart but shallow; but not one of
them ever found their way into notice; and though we
have not yet lived out our half century, they have in that
space all disappeared. There are various causes which
conspire to write it down as fate, that the humble infidel
should be unsuccessful in life. In the first place, infidelity
is not a mark of good sense, but very much the reverse.
We have been much struck by a passage which occurs in
the autobiography of a great general of the early part of
the last century. In relating the disasters and defeats
experienced in a certain campaign by two subordinate
general officers, chiefly through misconduct, and a lack
of the necessary shrewdness, he adds, &#8220;I ever suspected
the judgment of these men since I found that they professed
themselves infidels.&#8221; The sagacious general had
inferred that their profession of infidelity augured a lack
of sense; and that, when they got into command, the same
lack of sense which led them to glory in their shame would
be productive, as its necessary results, of misfortune and
disaster. There is a shrewd lesson here to the class who
doubt and cavil simply to show their parts. In the second
place, infidelity, on the principle of Bacon, is a weak,
tottering thing, unbuttressed by that support which gives
to poor human nature half its strength and all its dignity.
But, above all, in the third and last place, the humble
infidel, unballasted by right principle, sets out on the
perilous voyage of life without chart or compass, and,
drifting from off the safe course, gets among rocks and
breakers, and there perishes. But we must not trespass
on your time. With regard to the conduct of your studies,
we simply say, Strive to be catholic in your tastes. Some
of you will have a leaning to science; some to literature.
To the one class we would say, Your literature will be all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
the more solid if you can get a vein of true science to run
through it; and to the other, Your science will be all the
more fascinating if you temper and garnish it with literature.
In truth, almost all the greater subjects of man&#8217;s contemplation
belong to both fields. Of subjects such as astronomy
and geology, for instance, the poetry is as sublime
as the science is profound. As a pretty general rule, you
will perhaps find literature most engaging in youth, and
science as you grow in years. But faculties for both have
been given you by the great Taskmaster, and it is your
bounden duty that these be exercised aright. And so let
us urge you, in conclusion, in the words of Coleridge:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8220;</span>Therefore to go and join head, heart, and hand,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Active and firm to fight the bloodless fight</span><br />

<a name='DISRUPTION_PRINCIPLES' id='DISRUPTION_PRINCIPLES'></a>
<h2>DISRUPTION PRINCIPLES.</h2>
</div>
<p>One of the many dangers to which the members of a disestablished
Church just escaped from State control and the
turmoil of an exciting struggle are liable, is the danger of
getting just a little wild on minute semi-metaphysical points,
and of either quarrelling regarding them with their neighbours,
or of falling out among themselves. Great controversies,
involving broad principles, have in the history of
the Church not unfrequently broken into small controversies,
involving narrow principles; just as in the history
of the world mighty empires like that of Alexander the
Great have broken up into petty provinces, headed by mere
satraps and captains, when the master-mind that formed
their uniting bond has been removed. Independently of
that stability which the legalized framework of a rightly-constituted
Establishment is almost sure to impart to its
distinctive doctrines, the influence of its temporalities has
in one special direction a sobering and wholesome effect.
Men carefully weigh principles for the assertion of which
they may be called on to sacrifice or to suffer, and are
usually little in danger, in such circumstances, of becoming
martyrs to a mere crotchet. The first beginnings of notions
that, if suffered to grow in the mind, may at length tyrannize
over it, and lead even the moral sense captive, are
often exceedingly minute.</p>
<p>They start up in the form of, mayhap, solitary ideas,
chance-derived from some unexpected association, or picked
up in conversation or reading; the attention gradually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
concentrates upon them; auxiliary ideas, in consequence,
spring up around them; they assume a logical form&ndash;&ndash;connect
themselves, on the one hand, with certain revealed
injunctions of wide meaning&ndash;&ndash;lay hold, on the other, on a
previously developed devotional spirit or well-trained conscientiousness;
and, in the end, if the minds in which they
have arisen be influential ones, they alter the aspects and
names of religious bodies, and place in a state of insulation
and schism churches and congregations.</p>
<p>Their rise somewhat resembles that of the waves, as
described by Franklin in his paper on the effects of oil in
inducing a calm, or in preserving one. &#8216;The first-raised
waves,&#8217; he says, &#8216;are mere wrinkles; but being continually
acted upon by the wind, they are, though the gale does not
increase in strength, continually increased in magnitude,
rising higher, and extending their bases so as to include
in each wave vast masses, and to act with great momentum.
The wind, however,&#8217; continues the philosopher, &#8216;blowing
over water covered with oil, cannot <i>catch</i> upon it so as to
raise the first or elementary wrinkles, but slides over it, and
leaves it smooth as it finds it; and being thus prevented
from producing these first elements of waves, it of course
cannot produce the waves themselves.&#8217; In applying the
illustration just a little further, we would remark, that within
a wholesomely-constituted religious Establishment, the influence
of the temporalities acts in preventing the rise of
new notions, like the smoothing oil. If it does not wholly
prevent the formation of the first wrinkles of novel opinion,
it at least prevents their heightening into wavelets or seas.
If the billows rise within so as to disrupt the framework of
the Establishment, and make wreck of its temporalities, it
may be fairly premised that they have risen not from any
impulsion of the light winds of uncertain doctrine, but, as
in the Canton de Vaud and the Church of Scotland, in
obedience to the strong ground-swell of sterling principle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>Now we deem it a mighty advantage, and one which
should not be wilfully neutralized by any after act of the
body, that the distinctive principles of the Free Church
bear the stamp and pressure of sacrifice. The temporalities
resigned for their sake do not adequately measure their
value; but they at least demonstrate that, in the estimate
of those who resigned them, the principles did of a certainty
possess value up to the amount resigned. The Disruption
forms a guarantee for the stamina of our Church&#8217;s peculiar
tenets, and impresses upon them, in relation to the conscience
of the Church, the stamp of reality and genuineness.
And that influence of the temporalities to which we refer,
and under which the controversy grew, had yet another
wholesome influence. It prevented the wrinklings of new,
untried notions from gathering momentum, and rising into
waves. The great billows, influential in producing so
much, were the result of ancient, well-tested realities: they
had rolled downwards, fully formed, as a portion of the
great ground-swell of the Reformation. The Headship of
the adorable Redeemer&ndash;&ndash;the spiritual independence of the
Church&ndash;&ndash;the rights of the Christian people: these were not
crotchets based on foundations of bad metaphysics; they
were vital, all-important principles, worthy of being maintained
and asserted at any cost. It is indeed wonderful
how entirely, immediately previous to the Disruption, the
Church of Scotland assumed all the lineaments of her
former self, as she existed in the days of Knox and his
brethren. Once more, after the lapse of many years, she
stood on broad anti-patronage ground. Once more, after
having been swaddled up for an age in the narrow exclusiveness
of the Act of 1799, that had placed her in a
state of non-communion with the whole Christian world, she
occupied, through its repeal, the truly liberal position with
regard to the other evangelistic churches of her early fathers.
Once more her discipline, awakened from its long slumber,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
had become efficient, as in her best days, for every purpose
of purity. She had become, on the eve of her disestablishment,
after many an intervening metamorphosis, exactly, in
character and lineament, the Church which had been established
by the State nearly three centuries before. She went
out as she had come in. There was a peculiar sobriety,
too, in all her actings. Her sufferings and sacrifices were
direct consequents of the invasion of her province by the
civil magistrate.</p>
<p>But she did not on that account cease to recognise the
magistrate in his own proper walk as the minister of God.</p>
<p>Her aggrieved members never once forgot that they were
Scotchmen and Britons as certainly as Presbyterians, and
that they had a country as certainly as a Church to which
they owed service, and which it was unequivocally their
duty to defend.</p>
<p>They retreated from the Establishment, and gave up all
its advantages when the post had become so untenable that
these could be no longer retained with honour&ndash;&ndash;or we
should perhaps rather say, retained compatibly with right
principle; but they did not in wholesale desperation give
up other posts which could still be conscientiously maintained.</p>
<p>The educational establishment of the country, for instance,
was not abandoned, though the ecclesiastical one was.</p>
<p>The Principal of the United College of Saint Salvador
and Saint Leonard&#8217;s signed the Deed of Demission in his
capacity as an elder of the Church, but in his capacity of
Principal he returned to his College, and in that post
fought what was virtually the battle of his country, and
fought it so bravely and well that he is Principal of the
College still. And the parish schoolmasters who adhered
to the Free Church fought an exactly similar battle, though
unfortunately with a less happy issue; but that issue gives
at least prominence to the fact that they did not resign
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
their charges, but were thrust from them. The other
functionaries of the Assembly, uninfluenced by any wild
Cameronian notion, held by their various secular offices,
civil and military. Soldiers retained their commissions&ndash;&ndash;magistrates
their seats on the bench&ndash;&ndash;members of Parliament
their representative status. Nor did a single member
of the Protesting Church possessed of the franchise resign,
in consequence of the Disruption, a single political right
or privilege. The entire transaction bore, we repeat, the
stamp of perfect sobriety. It was in all its details the act
of men in their right minds.</p>
<p>Now the principles held by the Church at the Disruption,
and none other, whether Voluntary or Cameronian, are the
principles of the Free Church. A powerful majority in a
Presbyterian body, or in a country possessed of a representative
government, are vested in at least the <i>power</i> of
making whatever laws they will to make, for not only
themselves, but for the minority also. But <i>power</i> is not
<i>right</i>; and we would at once question the <i>right</i> of even a
preponderating majority in a Church such as ours to introduce
new principles into her framework, and to impose
them on the minority. We question, on this principle, the
<i>right</i> of that act of discipline which was exercised in the
present century by a preponderating majority of the Antiburgher
body in Scotland, when they deposed and excommunicated
the late Dr. M&#8217;Crie for the ecclesiastical offence
of holding in every particular by the original tenets of the
fathers of the Secession.</p>
<p>The overt act in the case manifested their <i>power</i>, but the
various attempts made to manifest their <i>right</i> we regard as
mere abortions. They had no <i>right</i> to do what they did.
The questions on which the majority differed from their
fathers ought in justice, instead of being made a subject of
legislation, to be left an open question. And we hold, on
a similar principle, that whatever questions of conduct or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
polity may arise in the Free Church, which, though new to
it, yet come to be adopted by a majority, should be left
open questions also. Of course, of novelties in doctrine
we do not speak,&ndash;&ndash;we trust that within the Free Church
none such will ever arise; we refer rather to those semi-metaphysical
points of casuistry, and nice questions of
conduct, in which the differences that perplex non-established
Churches are most liable to originate,&ndash;&ndash;matters in
which one man sees after one way, and another man after
another,&ndash;&ndash;and which, until heaped up into importance,
wave-like, as if by the wind, pertain not to the province
of solid demonstrable truth, but to the province of loose
fluctuating opinion. And be it remarked, that non-established
Churches are very apt to be disturbed by such
questions.</p>
<p>They are in circumstances in which the ripple passes into
the wavelet, and the wavelet into the billow. On this head,
as on all others, there is great value in the teachings of
history; and the Free Church might be worse employed
than in occasionally conning the lesson. Each fifty years
of the last century and half has been marked by its own
special questions of the kind among the non-established
Churches of Scotland.</p>
<p>The question of the last fifty years has been that Voluntary
one which virtually led to the striking off the roll of the
Antiburgher Secession Church, those protesting ministers
who formed the nucleus of the Original Secession, and to
the excommunication and deposition of Dr. M&#8217;Crie. The
question of the preceding fifty years was that connected
with the burghal oath, which had the effect of splitting into
two antagonist sections the religious body of which the
Burgher Secession formed but one of the fragments,&ndash;&ndash;a
body fast rising at the time into a position of importance,
which the split prevented it from ever fully realizing. The
question of the fifty years with which the period began was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
that which fixed the Cameronian body, not merely in a
condition of unsocial seclusion in its relation with all other
churches, but even detached it from its allegiance to the
State, and placed it in circumstances of positive rebellion.
Perhaps the history of this latter body, as embodied in its
older testimony, and the controversial writings of its Fairlys
and Thorburns, is that from the study of which the Free
Church might derive most profit at the present time. We
live in so late an age of the world, that we have little chance
of finding much which is positively new in the writings or
speeches of our casuists. When we detect, in consequence,
some of our ministers or office-bearers sporting principles
that do not distinctively belong to the Church of the
Disruption, we may be pretty sure, if we but search well,
of discovering these principles existing as the distinctive
tenets of some other Church; and the present tendency of
a most small but most respectable minority in our body is
decidedly Cameronian.</p>
<p>The passages of Scripture on which the Cameronians
chiefly dwelt in their testimony and controversial writings,
were those discussed by the Free Presbytery of Edinburgh
on Wednesday last. As condemnatory of what is designated
the great national sin of the Union, for instance, the testimony
adduces, among other texts, Isa. viii. 12, &#8216;Say ye not,
A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say,
A confederacy;&#8217; Hos. vii. 8, 9, &#8216;Ephraim hath mixed himself
among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned. Strangers
have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not; yea,
grey hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it
not;&#8217; and above all, 2 Cor. vi. 14, 15, &#8216;Be ye not unequally
yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath
righteousness with unrighteousness, and what communion
hath light with darkness, and what concord hath Christ
with Belial, or what part hath he that believeth with an
infidel?&#8217; And let the reader mark how logically these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
Scriptures are applied. &#8216;All associations and confederacies
with the enemies of true religion and godliness,&#8217; says the
Testimony, &#8216;are thus expressly condemned in Scripture,
and represented as dangerous to the true Israel of God.
And if simple confederacies with malignants and enemies
to the cause of Christ are condemned, much more is an
incorporation with them, which is an embodying of two
into one, and therefore a straiter conjunction. And, taking
the definition of malignants given by the declarations of
both kingdoms, joined in arms <i>anno</i> 1643, to be just, which
says, &#8220;Such as would not take the Covenant were to be
declared to be public enemies to religion and their country,
and that they are to be censured and punished as professed
adversaries and malignants,&#8221; it cannot be refused but
that the prelatic party in England now joined with are
such. Further, by this incorporating union this nation is
obliged to support the <i>idolatrous</i> Church of England.&#8217; And
thus the argument runs on irrefragable in its logic, if we
but grant the premises. But to what, we ask, did it lead,
assisted, of course, by other arguments of a similar character,
in the body with whom it originated? To their withdrawal,
from the times of the Revolution till now, from every
national movement in the cause of Christ and His gospel;
nay, most consistently, we must add&ndash;&ndash;for we have ever
failed to see the sense or logic of acting a public and
political part in our own or our neighbour&#8217;s behalf, and
declining on principle to act it in behalf of Christianity or
its institutions&ndash;&ndash;not only have they withdrawn themselves
from all political exertion in behalf of religion, but in
behalf of their country also. A Cameronian holding firm
by his principles of non-incorporation with <i>idolaters</i>, cannot
be a magistrate nor a member of Parliament; he cannot
vote in an election, nor serve in the army.</p>
<p>It is one of the grand evils of questions of casuistry of
this kind, that men, instead of looking at things and estimating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
them as they really exist, are contented to play games
at logic&ndash;&ndash;chopping with but the imperfect signs of things&ndash;&ndash;mere
verbal counters, twisted from their original meanings
by the influence of delusive metaphors and false associations.</p>
<p>Let us just see, in reference not to mere words, but to
things, what can be truly meant by the terms &#8216;apostate or
apostatizing Government,&#8217; as applied to the Government
of Great Britain. The words can have of course no just
application, in a personal bearing, to present members of
Government, as distinguished from the members of previous
Governments, seeing that the functionaries now in office are
just as much, or rather as little religious, as any other
functionaries in office since the times of the Revolution or
before. In a <i>personal</i> sense, England&#8217;s last religious government
was that of Cromwell. The term apostate, or apostatizing,
can have only an <i>official</i> meaning. What, then, in
its official meaning, does it in reality express? The government
of the United Kingdom is representative; and it is
one of the great blessings which we enjoy as citizens that it is
so,&ndash;&ndash;one of those blessings for which we may now, as when
we were younger, express ourselves thankful in the words of
honest Isaac Watts, &#8216;that we were born on British ground.&#8217;
At any rate, this fact of representation <i>is</i> a <i>fact</i>&ndash;&ndash;a <i>thing</i>,
not a mere <i>word</i>. There is another fact in the case equally
solid and certain. This representation of the empire is
based on a population of about twenty-six millions of people;
twelve millions of whom are Episcopalian, eight millions
Roman Catholic, three millions Presbyterian, and three
millions more divided among the various other Protestant
sects of the country. And this also is a <i>fact</i>&ndash;&ndash;a <i>thing</i>, not a
mere <i>word</i>.</p>
<p>In the good providence of God we were born the citizens
of an empire thus representative in its government, and
thus ecclesiastically constituted in its population.</p>
<p>And it would be a further fact consequent on the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
two, that the aggregate character of the Government would
represent the aggregate moral and ecclesiastical character
of the people, were every distinct portion into which the
people are parcelled to exert itself in proportion to its share
of political influence. But from the yet further fact, that
the portions have <i>not</i> always exerted themselves in equal
ratios, and from other causes, political and providential, the
character of the Government has considerably fluctuated&ndash;&ndash;now
representing one portion more in proportion to its
amount than its mere bulk warranted, anon another. Thus,
in the days of the Commonwealth, what are now the six
million Presbyterians and Independents, etc., had a British
Government wholly representative of themselves; while
what are now the twelve million Episcopalians and the
eight million Papists had none.</p>
<p>England at the time produced one of those men, of a
type surpassingly great, that the world fails to see once in
centuries; and, like Brennus of old, he flung his sword into
the lighter scale, and it straightway outweighed the other.
There then ensued a period of twenty-eight years, in which
Government represented only the Episcopalians and Papists:
and then a period of a hundred and forty years more, in
which it represented only the Episcopalians and Presbyterians.
And now&ndash;&ndash;for Popery, growing strong in the interval,
had been using all appliances in its own behalf, and
had not been met in the proper spiritual field&ndash;&ndash;it represents
Episcopacy, Roman Catholicism, and a minute, uninfluential
portion of the Presbyterian and other evangelistic
bodies. But how, it may be asked, has this result taken
place?</p>
<p>How is it only a moiety of these bodies that is represented?
Mainly, we unhesitatingly reply, through the influence
exerted by certain crotchets entertained by the bodies
themselves on their political standing. When Government
at the Revolution, instead of being as formerly representative
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
of Episcopacy and Popery, became representative of
Episcopacy and Presbytery, Cameronianism broke off, on
the plea that the governing power ought to be representative
of Presbytery only, and that it was apostate because it
was not; and the political influence of the body has been
ever since lost to the Protestant cause. Voluntaryism, on
the other hand, neutralized <i>its</i> influence, by holding that,
though quite at freedom to exert itself in the political walk
in attaining secular objects, religious objects are in that walk
unattainable, or at least not to be attained; and so <i>it</i> also
has been virtually lost to the Protestant cause. And now
a cloud like a man&#8217;s hand arises in our own Church, to
threaten a further secession from the ranks of the remaining
class, who strive to stamp upon the Government, through
the operation of the representative principle, at least a
modicum of the evangelistic character. And all this is
taking place in an age in which the battle for the integrity
of the Sabbath as a national institute, and other similar
battles, shall soon have to be decided on political ground.
If &#8216;apostate&#8217; or &#8216;apostatizing&#8217; be at all proper words in
reference to the <i>things</i> which we have here described, what,
we ask, save the want either of weight or of exertion on the
part of the <i>represented</i> bodies who complain of it, can be
properly regarded as the <i>cause</i> of that apostasy? A representative
Government, if the represented be Episcopalian,
will itself be officially Episcopalian; if the represented be
Papist, it will itself be officially Papist; if the represented
be Presbyterian, it will itself be officially Presbyterian; if
composed of all three together, the Government will bear
an aggregate average character; but if, on some crotchet,
the Presbyterians withdraw from the political field, while the
others exert themselves in that field to the utmost, it will
be Popish and Episcopalian exclusively. But for a result
so undesirable&ndash;&ndash;a result which, if Presbytery had been
formerly in the ascendant, might of course be called official
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
apostasy&ndash;&ndash;it would be the Presbyterian constituency that
would be to blame, not the Government.</p>
<p>It will be seen that this view of the real state of <i>things</i>
was that of Knox and Chalmers, and that they acted in due
accordance with it. We are told by the younger M&#8217;Crie,
in his admirable <i>Sketches of Scottish Church History</i>, &#8216;that
Knox and his brethren, perceiving that the whole ecclesiastical
property of the kingdom bade fair to be soon swallowed
up by the rapacity of the nobles, insisted that a considerable
portion of it should be reserved for the support of
the poor, the founding of universities and schools, and the
maintenance of an efficient ministry throughout the country.
At last,&#8217; continues the historian, &#8216;after great difficulty, the
Privy Council came to the determination that the ecclesiastical
revenues should be divided into three parts,&ndash;&ndash;that
two of them should be given to the ejected prelates
during their lives, which afterwards reverted to the nobility,
and that the third part should be divided between the
Court and the Protestant ministry.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; exclaimed Knox on hearing of this arrangement,
&#8216;if the end of this order be happy, my judgment fails me.
I see two parts freely given to the devil, and the third must
be divided between God and the devil.&#8217; Strong words
these. Here is a Government, according to Knox&#8217;s own
statement of the case, giving five-sixths to the devil, and
but a remaining sixth to God. But does Knox on that
account refuse God&#8217;s moiety? Does he set himself to
reason metaphysically regarding <i>his</i> degree of responsibility
for either what the devil got, or what the Government gave
the devil. Not he. He received God&#8217;s part, and in
applying it wisely and honestly to God&#8217;s service, wished it
more; but as for the rest, like a man of broad strong sense
as he assuredly was, he left the devil and the Privy Council
to divide the responsibility between them. And the large-minded
Chalmers entertained exactly the same views,&ndash;&ndash;views
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
which, if not in thorough harmony with the idle
fictions which dialecticians employ when they treat of
Governments, at least entirely accord with the real condition
of things. The official character of a representative
Legislature must, as we have shown, resemble that of the
constituency which it represents. In order to alter it permanently
for the better, it is essentially necessary, as a
first step in the process, that the worse parts of the constituencies
on which it rests be so altered.</p>
<p>Now, for altering constituencies for the better, schools
and churches were the machinery of Knox and of Chalmers;
and if the funds for the support of either came honestly to
them, unclogged with conditions unworthy of the object,
they at once received them as given on God&#8217;s behalf, however
idolatrously the givers&ndash;&ndash;whether individuals or Governments&ndash;&ndash;might
be employing money drawn from the same
purse in other directions. &#8216;Ought I,&#8217; said Chalmers in
reference to the Educational question, &#8216;ought I not to use,
on teetotal principles, the water of the public pump, because
another man mixes it with his toddy?&#8217; It was not
because Popery was established in the colonies, or seemed
in danger of being established in Ireland, that the Free
Church resigned its hold of the temporalities of the Scottish
Establishment. Such endowment, instead of forming an
argument for resignation, would form, on the contrary, an
argument for keeping faster hold, in behalf of Protestantism,
of the fortalice of the Establishment; just as if an invading
army had possessed itself of the Castle of Dumbarton, with
the strongholds of Fort-Augustus and Fort-William, the
argument would be all the stronger for the national forces
defending with renewed determination the Castles of Stirling
and of Edinburgh, and the magnificent defences of
Fort-George.</p>

<a name='CHARACTERISTICS_OF_THE_CRIMEAN_WAR' id='CHARACTERISTICS_OF_THE_CRIMEAN_WAR'></a>
<h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CRIMEAN WAR.</h2>
</div>
<p>The war now happily concluded was characterized by
some very remarkable features. It was on the part of
Britain the war of a highly civilised country, in a pre-eminently
mechanical, and, with all its faults, singularly
humane age,&ndash;&ndash;in an age, too, remarkable for the diffusion
of its literature; and hence certain conspicuous traits
which belonged to none of the other wars in which our
country had been previously engaged. Never before did
such completely equipped fleets and armies quit our shores.
The navies with which we covered the Black Sea and the
Baltic were not at all what they would have been had the
war lasted for one other campaign, but they mightily exceeded
anything of the kind that Britain or the world had
ever seen before. The fleets of Copenhagen, Trafalgar,
and the Nile would have cut but a sorry figure beside them,
and there was more of the <i>materiel</i> of war concentrated on
that one siege of Sebastopol than on any half-dozen other
sieges recorded in British history. In all that mechanical
art could accomplish, the late war with Russia was by far
the most considerable in which our country was ever engaged.
It was, in respect of <i>materiel</i>, a war of the world&#8217;s
pre-eminently mechanical people in the world&#8217;s pre-eminently
mechanical age. With this strong leading
feature, however, there mingled another, equally marked,
in which the element was weakness, not strength. The
men who beat all the world in heading pins are unable
often to do anything else; for usually, in proportion as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
mechanical skill becomes intense, does it also become
narrow; and the history of the two campaigns before Sebastopol
brought out very strikingly a certain helplessness
on the part of the British army, part of which at least must
be attributed to this cause. It is surely a remarkable fact,
that in an army never more than seven miles removed from
the base line of its operations, the distress suffered was so
great, that nearly <i>five</i> times the number of men sank under
it that perished in battle. There was no want among them
of pinheading and pinheaded martinets. The errors of
officers such as Lucan and Cardigan are understood to be
all on the side of severity; but in heading their pin, they
wholly exhaust their art; and under their surveillance and
direction a great army became a small one, with the sea
covered by a British fleet only a few miles away. So far as
the statistics of the British portion of this greatest of sieges
have yet been ascertained, rather more than <i>three</i> thousand
men perished in battle by the shot or steel of the enemy,
or afterwards of their wounds, and rather more than <i>fifteen</i>
thousand men of privation and disease. As for the poor
soldiers themselves, they could do but little in even more
favourable circumstances under the pinheading martinets;
and yet at least such of them as were drawn from the more
thoroughly artificial districts of the country must, we suspect,
have fared all the worse in consequence of that subdivision
of labour which has so mightily improved the
mechanical standing of Britain in the aggregate, and so
restricted and lowered the general ability in individuals.
We cannot help thinking that an army of backwoodsmen
of the present day, or of Scotch Highlanders marked by the
prevailing traits of the last century, would have fared better
and suffered less.</p>
<p>Another remarkable feature of the war arose out of the
singularly ready and wonderfully diffused literature of the
day. Like those self-registering machines that keep a strict
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
account of their own workings, it seemed to be engaged,
as it went on, in writing, stage after stage, its own history.
The acting never got a single day ahead of the writing,
and never a single week ahead of the publishing; and,
in consequence, the whole civilised world became the interested
witnesses of what was going on. The war became a
great game at chess, with a critical public looking over the
shoulders of the players. It was a peculiar feature, too, that
the public <i>should</i> have been so critical. As the literature of
a people becomes old, it weakens in the power of originating,
and strengthens in the power of criticising. Reviews and
critiques become the master efforts of a learned and ingenious
people, whose literature has passed its full blow;
and the criticism extends always, in countries in which the
press is free from the productions of men who write in their
closets, to the actings of men who conduct the political
business of the country, or who direct its fleets and armies.
And with regard to them also it may be safely affirmed, that
the critical ability overshoots and excels the originating
ability. There seems to have been no remarkably good
generalship manifested by Britain in the Crimea: all the
leading generalship appears, on the contrary, to have been
very mediocre generalship indeed. The common men and
subordinate officers did their duty nobly; and there have
been such splendid examples of skilful generalship in fourth
and fifth-rate commands&ndash;&ndash;commands such as that of Sir
Colin Campbell and Sir George Brown&ndash;&ndash;that it has been
not unfrequently asked, whether we had in reality the &#8216;right
men in the right places,&#8217; and whether there might not, after
all, have been generalship enough in the Crimea had it been
but rightly arranged. But the leading generalship was certainly
<i>not</i> brilliant. The criticism upon it, on the other
hand, has been singularly so. The ages of Marlborough
and Wellington did not produce a tithe of the brilliant
military criticism which has appeared in England in newspapers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
magazines, and reviews during the last two years.
And yet it is possible that, had the very cleverest of these
critics been appointed to the chief command, he would
have got on as ill as any of his predecessors. In truth, the
power of originating and the power of criticising are essentially
different powers in the worlds both of thought and of
action. Talent accumulates the materials of criticism from
the experience of the past; and thus, as the world gets
older, the critical ability grows, and becomes at length
formidably complete;&ndash;&ndash;whereas the power of originating,
or, what is the same thing, of acting wisely, and on the
spur of the moment, in new and untried circumstances, is
an incommunicable faculty, which genius, and genius only,
can possess. And genius is as rare now as it ever was.
Any man of talent can be converted, by dint of study and
painstaking, into a good military critic; but a Wellington
or a Napoleon had as certainly to be born what they were,
as a Dante or a Milton.</p>
<p>But by far the most pleasing feature of the war&ndash;&ndash;of at
least the part taken in it by Britain&ndash;&ndash;is to be found in that
humanity, the best evidence of a civilisation truly Christian,
which has characterized it in all its stages. Generous regard
for the safety and respect for the feelings of a brave
enemy, when conquered, have marked our countrymen for
centuries. But we owe it to the peculiar philanthropy of the
time, that, in the midst of much official neglect, our own sick
and wounded soldiers have been cared for after a fashion in
which British soldiers were never cared for before. The &#8216;lady
nurses,&#8217; with Miss Nightingale at their head, imparted its
most distinctive character to the war. We have now before
us a deeply interesting volume,<a name='FNanchor_0020' id='FNanchor_0020'></a><a href='#Footnote_0020' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> the production of one of
these devoted females, a native of the north country, or, as
she was introduced by an old French officer to some Zouaves,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
her fellow-passengers to the East, whom she had wished to
see, a true &#8216;<i>Montagnarde de Ecossaise</i>.&#8217; The name of the
authoress is not given; but it will, we daresay, be recognised
in the neighbourhood of the &#8216;capital of the Highlands&#8217;
as that of a delicately nurtured lady, the daughter of
a late distinguished physician, well known to the north of
the Grampians as an able and upright man, who, had he
not so sedulously devoted himself to the profession which
he adorned, might have excelled in almost any department
of science. And in strong sound sense and genial feeling,
we find the daughter worthy of such a father. Some of
our more zealous Protestants professed at one time not a
little alarm lest the lady nurses might be Papists in disguise;
and certainly their &#8216;regulation dresses,&#8217; all cut after
one fashion, and of one sombre hue, did seem a little nun-like,
and perhaps rather alarming. But the following passage&ndash;&ndash;which,
from the amusing mixture which it exhibits
of strong good sense and half-indignant womanly feeling,
our readers will, we are sure, relish&ndash;&ndash;may serve to show
that some of the ladies who wore the questionable dress,
liked it quite as ill as the most zealous member of the
Reformation Society could have done, and were very excellent
Protestants under its cover. The authoress of the
volume before us is a Presbyterian; and the occasion of
the following remarks was the meeting of the British Consul
at Marseilles, and the necessity that herself and her companions
felt of getting head-dresses for themselves, that
could be looked at ere entertaining him at dinner. &#8216;Perhaps
it may be thought,&#8217; says our authoress, &#8216;that all this
solicitude about our caps was unsuitable in persons going
out as what is called &#8220;Sisters of Mercy;&#8221; but I must once
for all say that, as far as I was concerned, I neither professed
to be a &#8220;Sister of Charity,&#8221; a &#8220;Sister of Mercy,&#8221;
nor anything of the kind. I was, as I told a <i>poissarde</i> of
Boulogne, a British woman who had little to do at home,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
and wished to help our poor soldiers, if I could, abroad.
The reason given to me for the peculiarity and uniformity
of our dress was, that the soldiers might know and respect
their nurses. It seems a sensible reason, and one which
I could not object to, even disliking, as I did, all peculiarity
of attire that seemed to advertise the nurses only as
serving God, or serving Him pre-eminently, and thus conveying
a tacit reproach to the rest of the world; for the
obligation lies on all the same. I did not feel then, nor do
I now, that we were doing anything better or more praiseworthy
than is done in a quiet, unostentatious way at home
every day. On the contrary, to many temperaments, my
own among the number, it is far less difficult to engage in
a new and exciting work like the one we were then entering
on there, than to pursue the uneventful monotony of
daily doing good at home. As for the dress itself, I have
nothing to say against it. Although not perhaps of the
material or texture I should have preferred, still the colour,
grey, was one I generally wore from choice. But I must
confess, that when I found myself restricted to it, without
what seemed a good reason, an intense desire for blue,
green, red, and yellow, with all their combinations, took
possession of me; though, now that I may wear what I
please, I find my former favour for grey has returned in
full force. However, allowing that it was desirable we
should have had some uniform costume, it certainly was
unnecessary that ladies, nurses, and washerwomen should
have been dressed alike, as we were. That was part of the
mistake I have already adverted to, and was productive of
confusion and bad feeling.&#8217;</p>
<p>Despite of the uniform dresses, however, the sick and
wounded soldiers soon learned to distinguish between the
paid nurses and the ladies who had left their comfortable
British homes to lavish upon them their gratuitous, priceless
labours.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There is no assumption in this volume. Its authoress
writes as if she had done only her duty, and as if the task
had not been an exceedingly hard or difficult one; but the
simple facts related show how very much was accomplished
and endured. Every chapter justifies the judgment pronounced
by the tall Irish sergeant. This lady nurse is a
&#8216;real fine woman,&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;a noble specimen of the class whose
disinterested and self-sacrificing exertions gave to the late
war its most distinctive and brilliant feature. The bravery
of British men had been long established; the superadded
trait is the heroism of British women. In what circumstances
of peril and suffering that heroism was exerted, the
following extract, with which we conclude, may serve to
show. It is the funeral of one of the lady nurses, who
sank under an attack of malignant fever, that the following
striking passage records:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8216;The Protestant burial-ground is a dismal-looking, neglected
spot. It was chosen from an idea that Drusilla&#8217;s
friends at home might prefer it to the open hill where the
soldiers lay; but if there had been time for consideration
and inspection, it would have been otherwise arranged: for
the appearance of the place struck a chill to our hearts&ndash;&ndash;it
looked so dark and dreary, with the grass more than a foot
high, and the weeds towering above it; and from its being
close to the bay, and the porous nature of the soil, the
grave which had been dug on the forenoon was almost
filled by water; and on the words, &#8220;Forasmuch as it hath
pleased Almighty God,&#8221; we heard the coffin splash into the
half-full grave. There was a general regret afterwards that
this burial-ground had been chosen, but poor Drusilla will
not sleep the less soundly; and we all agreed, on leaving
her grave, that whoever of us was next called to die, should
be buried on the hill, in the spot allotted to the poor
soldiers, open and unprotected as it was. Death seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
very near to us then; we had already lost two orderlies,
and many of the nurses were lying at the gates of death.
Miss A&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; had made an almost miraculous escape, and
was not yet out of danger from relapse. The first gap had
been made in our immediate party, and who of us could tell
whether she herself was not to be the next?</p>
<p>&#8216;The evening was fast closing as we returned, some in
caiques, and others walking solemnly and sadly; for, besides
the feelings naturally attending such a scene, we all regretted
poor Drusilla, who, although she had not been long among
us, was so obliging and anxious to be of use. She was a
good-looking young woman, and immediately on her arrival
had become the object of attraction to one of the clerks,
whose attentions, however, she most steadily declined. He
still persisted in showing the most extraordinary attachment
to her, and during her illness was in such a state of excitement
and distress as to be utterly incapacitated for attending
to his duties properly. He used to sit on the stairs
leading to her room, in the hopes of seeing some one who
could tell him how she was, and went perpetually to the
passage outside her room, entreating of the Misses Le
M&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, who generally sat up with her, to let him in to
see her. This they refused till the night of her death,
when she was quite insensible, and past all hope of recovery;
so that his visit could do her no harm. He stayed
a few minutes, and looked his last on her; for in the morning
at seven o&#8217;clock she died. I shall never forget his face
when he came to my store-room, in accordance with his
duty, to correct some inaccuracy in the diet-roll. He
seemed utterly bewildered with sorrow; and Miss S&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;,
who had also occasion to speak to him, said she never saw
grief so strongly marked in a human face. He insisted on
following her remains to the grave as chief mourner, and
wearied himself with carrying the coffin. No one interfered
with him; for all seemed to think he had acquired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
the right, by his unmistakeable affection, to perform these
sad offices; and the lady superintendent, moved by his
sorrow, allowed him to retain a ring of some small value
which the deceased had been accustomed to wear.&#8217;</p>

<h2>THE POETS OF THE CHURCH.</h2>
</div>
<p>It is not uninteresting to mark the rise and progress of
certain branches of poetry and the <i>belles lettres</i> in their
connection with sects and Churches. They form tests by
which at least the taste and literary standing of these bodies
can be determined; and the degree of success with which
they are cultivated within the same Church, in different ages,
throws at times very striking lights on its condition and
history. One wholly unacquainted with the recorded annals
of the Church of Scotland might safely infer, from its literature
alone, that it fared much more hardly in the seventeenth
century, during which the literature of England rose to its
highest pitch of grandeur, than in the previous sixteenth,
in which its Knoxes, Buchanans, and Andrew Melvilles
flourished; and further, that its eighteenth century was,
on the whole, a quiet and tranquil time, in which even
mediocrity had leisure afforded it to develope itself in its
full proportions. Literature is not the proper business of
Churches; but it is a means, though not an end. And it
will be found that all the better Churches have been as
literary as they could; and that, if at any time the literature
has been defective, it has been rather their circumstances
that were unpropitious, than themselves that were in fault.
Their enemies have delighted to represent the case differently.
Our readers must remember the famous instance
in <i>Old Mortality</i>, so happily exposed by the elder M&#8217;Crie,
in which Sir Walter, when he makes his Sergeant Bothwell
a writer of verses, introduces Burley as peculiarly a verse-hater,
and &#8216;puts into his mouth that condemnation of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
elegant pursuits which he imputes to the whole party;&#8217;
&#8216;overlooking or suppressing the fact,&#8217; says the Doctor,
&#8216;that there was at that very time in the camp of the Covenanters
a man who, besides his other accomplishments,
was a poet superior to any on the opposite side.&#8217; It is
equally a fact, however, and shows how thoroughly the
mind of even a highly intellectual people may be prostrated
by a long course of tyranny and persecution, that Scotland
had properly no literature after the extinction of its old
classical school in the person of Drummond of Hawthornden,
until the rise of Thomson. The age in England of
Milton and of Cowley, of Otway, of Waller, of Butler, of
Dryden, and of Denham, was in Scotland an age without a
poet vigorous enough to survive in his writings his own
generation. For even the greater part of the popular
version of its Psalms, our Church was indebted to the
English lawyer Rous. Here and there we may find in it
the remains of an earlier and more classical time: its version
of the hundredth Psalm, for instance, with its quaintly-turned
but stately octo-syllabic stanzas, was written nearly
a hundred years earlier than most of the others, by William
Keith, a Scottish contemporary of Beza and Buchanan, and
one of the translators of the Geneva Bible. But we find
little else that is Scotch in it; the Church to which, in the
previous age, the author of the most elegant version of the
Psalms ever given to the world had belonged, had now&ndash;&ndash;notwithstanding
the exertions of its Zachary Boyds&ndash;&ndash;to import
its poetry. In the following century, the Church shared in
the general literature of the time. She missed, and but
barely missed, having one of its greatest poets to herself&ndash;&ndash;the
poet Thomson&ndash;&ndash;who at least carried on his studies so
far with a view to her ministry, as to commence delivering
his probationary discourses. We fear, however, he would
have made but an indolent minister; and that, though his
occasional sermons, judging from the hymn which concludes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
the <i>Seasons</i>, might have been singularly fine ones, they
would have been marvellously few, and very often repeated.
The greatest poet that did actually arise within the Church
during the century was Thomson&#8217;s contemporary, Robert
Blair,&ndash;&ndash;a man who was not an idle minister, and who,
unlike his cousin Hugh, belonged to the evangelical side.
The author of the <i>Grave</i> was one of the bosom friends of
Colonel Gardiner, and a valued correspondent of Doddridge
and Watts. Curiously enough, though the great merit of
his piece has been acknowledged by critics such as Southey,
it has been regarded as an imitation of the <i>Night Thoughts</i>
of Young. &#8216;Blair&#8217;s <i>Grave</i>,&#8217; says Southey in his <i>Life of
Cowper</i>, &#8216;is the only poem I can call to mind which has
been composed in imitation of the <i>Night Thoughts</i>;&#8217; and
though Campbell himself steered clear of the error, we find
it introduced in a note, as supplementary to the information
regarding Blair given in his <i>Essay on English Poetry</i> by his
editor, Mr. Cunningham. It is demonstrable, however,
that the Scotchman could not have been the imitator. As
shown by a letter in the Doddridge collection, which bears
date more than a twelvemonth previous to that of the
publication of even the first book of the <i>Night Thoughts</i>,
Blair, after stating that his poem, then in the hands of
Isaac Watts, had been offered without success to two
London publishers, states further, that the greater part of it
had been written previous to the year 1731, ere he had yet
entered the ministry; whereas the first book of Young&#8217;s
poem was not published until the year 1744. Poetry such as
that of Blair is never the result of imitation: its verbal happinesses
are at least as great as those of the <i>Night Thoughts</i>
themselves, and its power and earnestness considerably
greater. &#8216;The eighteenth century,&#8217; says Thomas Campbell,
&#8216;has produced few specimens of blank verse of so powerful
and simple a character as that of the <i>Grave</i>. It is a popular
poem, not merely because it is religious, but because its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
language and imagery are free, natural, and picturesque.
The latest editor of the poets has, with singularly bad taste,
noted some of the author&#8217;s most nervous and expressive
phrases as vulgarisms, among which he reckons that of
friendship, the &#8220;solder of society.&#8221; Blair may be a homely,
and even a gloomy poet, in the eye of fastidious criticism;
but there is a masculine and pronounced character even in
his gloom and homeliness, that keeps it most distinctly apart
from either dulness or vulgarity. His style pleases us like
the powerful expression of a countenance without regular
beauty.&#8217; Such is the judgment on Blair&ndash;&ndash;destined, in all
appearance, to be a final one&ndash;&ndash;of a writer who was at once
the most catholic of critics and the most polished of poets.
There succeeded to the author of the <i>Grave</i>, a group of
poets of the Church, of whom the Church has not been
greatly in the habit of boasting. Of Home, by a curious
chance the successor of Blair in his parish, little need be
said. He produced one good play and five enormously bad
ones; and his connection with the Church was very much an
accident, and soon dissolved. Blacklock, too, was as much
a curiosity as a poet; and, save for his blindness, would
scarce have been very celebrated in even his own day. Nor
was Ogilvie, though more favourably regarded by Johnson
than most of his Scottish contemporaries, other than a
mediocre poet. He is the author, however, of a very respectable
paraphrase&ndash;&ndash;the sixty-second&ndash;&ndash;of all his works the one
that promises to live longest; and we find the productions
of several other poets of the Church similarly preserved,
whose other writings have died. And yet the group of
Scottish <i>literati</i> that produced our paraphrases, if looking
simply to literary accomplishment&ndash;&ndash;we do not demand
genius&ndash;&ndash;must be regarded as a very remarkable one, when
we consider that the greater number of the individuals
which composed it were all at one time the ministers of
a single Church, and that one of the smallest. We know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
of no Church, either in Britain or elsewhere, that could
now command such a committee as that which sat, at the
bidding of the General Assembly, considerably more than
sixty years ago, to prepare the &#8216;Translations and Paraphrases.&#8217;
Of the sixty-eight pieces of which the collection
is composed, thirty are the work of Scottish ministers; and
the groundwork of most of the others, furnished in large
part by the previously existing writings of Watts and Doddridge,
has been greatly improved, in at least the composition,
by the emendations of Morrison and Logan.
With all its faults, we know of no other collection equal
to it as a whole. The meretricious stanzas of Brady and
Tate are inanity itself in comparison. True, the later
Blair, though always sensible, was ofttimes quite heavy
enough in the pieces given to him to render&ndash;&ndash;more so
than in his prose; though, even when first introduced to
that, Cowper could exclaim, not a little to the chagrin of
those who regarded it as perfection of writing: &#8216;Oh, the
sterility of that man&#8217;s fancy! if, indeed, he has any such
faculty belonging to him. Dr. Blair has such a brain as
Shakespeare somewhere describes, &#8220;dry as the remainder
biscuit after a voyage.&#8217;&#8221; But the fancy that Blair wanted,
poor Logan had; and the man who too severely criticises
his flowing and elegant paraphrases would do well to beware
of the memories of his children. A poet whose pieces
cannot be forgotten may laugh at the critics. Altogether,
our &#8216;Translations and Paraphrases&#8217; are highly creditable
to the literary taste and ability of the Church during the
latter half of the last century; and it serves to show how
very much matters changed in this respect in about forty
years, that while in the earlier period the men fitted for
such work were all to be found within the pale of the
Church&#8217;s ministry, at a later time, when the late Principal
Baird set himself, with the sanction of the General Assembly,
to devise means for adding to the collection, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
for revising our metrical version of the Psalms, he had to
look for assistance almost exclusively to poets outside the
precincts of even its membership.</p>
<p>And yet, even at this later time, the Church had its true
poets&ndash;&ndash;poets who, though, according to Wordsworth, they
&#8216;wanted the accomplishment of verse,&#8217; were of larger calibre
and greater depth than their predecessors. Chalmers had
already produced his <i>Astronomical Discourses</i>, and poor
Edward Irving had begun to electrify his London audiences
with the richly antique imagination and fiery fervour of
his singularly vigorous orations. Stewart of Cromarty, too,
though but comparatively little known, was rising, in his
quiet parish church, into flights of genuine though unmeasured
poetry, of an altitude to which minor poets, in
their nicely rounded stanzas, never attain. Nor is the race
yet extinct. Jeffrey used to remark, that he found more
true feeling in the prose of Jeremy Taylor than in the works
of all the second-class British poets put together; and those
who would now wish to acquaint themselves with the higher
and more spirit-rousing poetry of our Church, would have
to seek it within earshot of the pulpits of Bruce, of Guthrie,
and of James Hamilton. Still, however, it ever affords us
pleasure to find it in the more conventional form of classic
and harmonious verse. A Church that possesses her poets
gives at least earnest in the fact that she is not falling
beneath the literature of her age; and much on this account,
but more, we think, from their great intrinsic merit,
have we been gratified by the perusal of a volume of poems
which has just issued from the press under the name of
one of our younger Free Church ministers, the Rev. James
D. Burns. We are greatly mistaken if Mr. Burns be not
a genuine poet, skilled, as becomes a scholar and a student
of classic lore, in giving to his verse the true artistic form,
but not the less born to inherit the &#8216;vision and the faculty&#8217;
which cannot be acquired. Most men of great talent have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
their poetic age: it is very much restricted, however, to
the first five years of full bodily development, also particularly
then a sterner and more prosaic mood follows. But recollections
of the time survive; and it is mainly through
the medium of these recollections that in the colder periods
the feelings and visions of the poets continue to be appreciated
and felt. It was said of Thomson the poet by
Samuel Johnson, that he could not look at two candles
burning other than poetically. The phrase was employed
in conversation by <i>old</i> Johnson; but it must have been the
experience of <i>young</i> Johnson, derived from a time long
gone by, that suggested it. It is characteristic of the poetic
age, that objects which in later life become commonplace
in the mind, are then surrounded as if by a halo of poetic
feeling. The candles were, no doubt, an extreme illustration;
but there is scarce any object in nature, and there
are very few in art, especially if etherealized by the adjuncts
of antiquity or association, that are not capable of being
thus, as it were, embathed in sentiment. With the true
poet, the ability of investing every object with a poetic
atmosphere remains undiminished throughout life; and we
find it strikingly manifested in the volume before us. In
almost every line in some of the pieces we find a distinct
bit of picture steeped in poetic feeling. The following
piece, peculiarly appropriate to the present time, we adduce
as an illustration of our meaning:&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<p>This is surely genuine poetry both in form and matter;
as just in its thinking as it is vivid in its imagery and classic
in its language. The vein of strong sense which runs
through all the poetry of Mr. Burns, and imparts to it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
solidity and coherency, is, we think, not less admirable
than the poetry itself, and is, we are sure, quite as little
common. Let the reader mark how freely the thoughts
arise in the following very exquisite little piece, written in
Madeira, and suggested by the distant view of the neighbouring
island of Porto Santo, one of the first colonized
by the Portuguese adventurers of the fifteenth century.
Columbus married a daughter of Bartolomeo Perestrillo,
the first governor of the island, and after his marriage
lived in it for some time with his father-in-law. And on
this foundation Mr. Burns founds his poem:&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<p>There runs throughout Mr. Burns&#8217;s volume a rich vein
of scriptural imagery and allusion, and much oriental description&ndash;&ndash;rather
quiet, however, than gorgeous&ndash;&ndash;that bears
in its unexaggerated sobriety the impress of truth. From
a weakness of chest and general delicate health, Mr. Burns
has had to spend not a few of his winters abroad, under
climatal influences of a more genial character than those
of his own country; and hence the truthfulness of his
descriptions of scenes which few of our native poets ever
see, and a corresponding amount of variety in his verse.
But we have exhausted our space, and have given only
very meagre samples of this delightful volume, and a very
inadequate judgment on its merits. But we refer our
readers to the volume itself, as one well fitted to grow upon
their regards; and meanwhile conclude with the following
exquisite landscape,&ndash;&ndash;no bad specimen of that ability of
word-painting which is ever so certain a mark of the true

<h2>THE ENCYCLOP&AElig;DIA BRITANNICA.</h2>
</div>
<p>After the labour of years, the seventh edition of the
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> has been at length completed.
It is in every respect a great work&ndash;&ndash;great even as a commercial
speculation. We have been assured the money
expended on this edition alone would be more than sufficient
to build three such monuments as that now in the
course of erection in Edinburgh to the memory of Sir
Walter Scott. And containing, as it does, all the more
valuable matter of former editions&ndash;&ndash;all that the advancing
tide of knowledge has not obliterated or covered up, and
which at one time must have represented in the commercial
point of view a large amount of capital&ndash;&ndash;it must be obvious
that, great as the cost of the present edition has been, it
bears merely some such relation to the accumulated cost
of the whole, as that borne by the expense of partial renovations
and repairs in a vast edifice to the sum originally
expended on the entire erection.</p>
<p>It is a great work, too, regarded as a trophy of the united
science and literature of Britain. Like a lofty obelisk,
raised to mark the spot where some important expedition
terminated, it stands as it were to indicate the line at which
the march of human knowledge has now arrived. We see
it rising on the extreme verge of the boundary which
separates the clear and the palpable from the indistinct
and the obscure. The explored province of past research,
with all its many party-coloured fields, stretches out from
it in long perspective on the one hand,&ndash;&ndash;luminous, well-defined,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
rejoicing in the light. The <i>terra incognita</i> of future
discovery lies enveloped in cloud on the other&ndash;&ndash;an untried
region of fogs and darkness.</p>
<p>The history of this publication for the last seventy years&ndash;&ndash;for
so slow has been its growth, that rather more than
seventy years have now elapsed since its first appearance
in the world of letters&ndash;&ndash;would serve curiously to illustrate
the literary and scientific history of Scotland during that
period. The naturalist, by observing the rings of annual
growth in a tree newly cut down, can not only tell what its
exact bulk had been at certain determinate dates in the
past&ndash;&ndash;from its first existence as a tiny sapling of a single
twelvemonth, till the axe had fallen on the huge circumference
of perchance its hundredth ring&ndash;&ndash;but he can also
form from them a shrewd guess of the various characters
of the seasons that have passed over it. Is the ring of
wide development?&ndash;&ndash;it speaks of genial warmth and kindly
showers. Is it narrow and contracted?&ndash;&ndash;it tells of scorching
droughts or of biting cold. Now the succeeding editions
of this great work narrate a somewhat similar story,
in a somewhat similar manner. They speak of the growth
of science and the arts during the various succeeding
periods in which they appeared. The great increase, too,
at certain times, in particular departments of knowledge,
is curiously connected with peculiar circumstances in the
history of our country. In the present edition, for instance,
almost all the geography is new. The age has been peculiarly
an age of exploration&ndash;&ndash;a locomotive age: commerce,
curiosity, the spirit of adventure, the desire of escaping
from the tedium of inactive life,&ndash;&ndash;these, and other motives
besides, have scattered travellers by hundreds, during the
period of our long European peace, over almost every
country of the world. And hence so mighty an increase
of knowledge in this department, that what the last age
knew of the subject has been altogether overgrown. Vast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
additions, too, have been made to the province of mechanical
contrivance: the constructive faculties of the
country, stimulated apparently by the demands of commerce
and the influence of competition both at home and
abroad, have performed in well-nigh a single generation
the work of centuries.</p>
<p>Even the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> itself, regarded in a literary point
of view, is strikingly illustrative of a change which has
taken place chiefly within the present century in the republic
of letters.</p>
<p>We enjoyed a very ample opportunity of acquainting
ourselves with it in its infancy. More years have passed
away than we at present feel quite inclined to specify, since
our attention was attracted at a very early age to an <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>,
the first we had ever seen, that formed one work
of a dozen or so stored on the upper shelf of a press to
which we were permitted access. It consisted of three
quarto volumes sprinkled over with what seventy years ago
must have been deemed very respectable copperplates, and
remarkable, chiefly in the arrangement of its contents, for
the inequality of the portions, if we may so speak, into
which the knowledge it contained was broken up. As
might be anticipated from its comparatively small size,
most of the articles were exceedingly meagre. There were
pages after pages in which some eight or ten lines, sometimes
a single line, comprised all that the writers had
deemed it necessary to communicate on the subjects on
which they touched. And yet, set full in the middle of
these brief sentences&ndash;&ndash;these mere skeletons of information&ndash;&ndash;there
were complete and elaborate treatises,&ndash;&ndash;whales
among the minnows. Some of these extended over ten,
twenty, thirty, fifty pages of the work. We remember
there was an old-fashioned but not ill-written treatise on
<i>Chemistry</i> among the number, quite bulky enough of itself
to fill a small volume. There was a sensibly written treatise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
on <i>Law</i>, too; a treatise on <i>Anatomy</i> not quite unworthy
of the Edinburgh school; a treatise on <i>Botany</i>, of which at
this distance of time we remember little else than that it
rejected the sexual system of Linn&aelig;us, then newly promulgated;
a treatise on <i>Architecture</i>, sufficiently incorrect, as
we afterwards found, in some of its minor details, but which
we still remember with the kindly feeling of the pupil for
his first master; a treatise on <i>Fortification</i>, that at least
taught us how to make model forts in sand; treatises on
<i>Arithmetic</i>, <i>Astronomy</i>, <i>Bookkeeping</i>, <i>Grammar</i>, <i>Language</i>,
<i>Theology</i>, <i>Metaphysics</i>, and a great many other treatises
besides. The least interesting portion of the work was
the portion devoted to Natural History: it named and
numbered species and varieties, instead of describing
instincts and habits, and afforded little else to the reader
than lists of hard words, and lines of uninteresting numerals.
But our appetite for books was keen and but ill supplied at
the time, and so we read all of the work that would read,&ndash;&ndash;some
of it oftener than once. The character of the whole
reminded us somewhat of that style of building common in
some of the older ruins of the north country, in which we
find layers of huge stones surrounded by strips and patches
of a minute pinned work composed of splinters and fragments.</p>
<p>This Dictionary of the three quarto volumes was the
first edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>,&ndash;&ndash;the identical
work in its first beginnings, of which the seventh edition
has been so recently completed. It was published in 1771&ndash;&ndash;in
the days of Goldsmith, and Burke, and Johnson, and
David Hume&ndash;&ndash;several years ere Adam Smith had given
his <i>Wealth of Nations</i> or Robertson his <i>History of America</i>
to the public, and ere the names of Burns or Cowper had
any place in <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>British Literature</span>.</p>
<p>The world has grown greatly in knowledge since that
period, and the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> has done much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
more than kept pace with it in its merits of acquirement.
The three volumes have swelled into twenty-one; and each
of the twenty-one contains at least one-third more of matter
than each of the three. The growth and proportions of a
work of genius seem to be very little dependent on the
period of its production. Shakespeare may be regarded as
the founder of the English drama. He wrote at a time
when art was rude, and science comparatively low. All
agree, at least, that the subjects of Queen Victoria know a
very great deal which was not known by the subjects of
Queen Elizabeth. There was no gas burned in front of
the Globe Theatre, nor was the distant roar of a <i>locomotive</i>
ever heard within its dingy recesses; nor did ever adventurous
aeronaut look down from his dizzy elevation of miles
on its tub-like proportions, or its gay flag of motley. And
yet we question whether even Mr. Wakley himself, with all
his advantages, would venture to do more than assert his
equality with the Swan of Avon. Homer, too, wrote in a
very remote period,&ndash;&ndash;so very remote and so very uncertain,
that the critics have begun seriously to doubt whether the
huge figure of the blind old man, as it looms through the
grey obscure of ages, be in reality the figure of one poet, or of
a whole school of poets rolled up into a bundle. But though
men fight much more scientifically now than they did at
Troy, and know much more about the taking and defending
of walled towns, no poet of the present day greatly excels
Homer,&ndash;&ndash;no, not the Scotch schoolmaster even who wrote
Wolfe&#8217;s Ode, or the gentleman who sends us abstruse verses
which we unluckily cannot understand, and then scolds us
in perspicuous prose for not giving them a place in our
columns.</p>
<p>Works of genius bear no reference in their bulk and proportions,
if we may so speak, to the period at which they
are produced; but it is far otherwise with works of science
and general information: they grow with the world&#8217;s growth;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
the tomes from which the father derived his acquaintance
with facts and principles, prove all inadequate to satisfy the
curiosity of the son: almost every season adds its ring to
the &#8216;tree of knowledge;&#8217; and the measuring line which
girthed and registered its bulk in one age, fails to embrace
it in the succeeding one. And hence one element at least
in the superiority of this edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>
to every other edition, and every other Encyclop&aelig;dia.</p>
<p>It appears at the period of the world&#8217;s greatest experience.
But there are other very important elements, characteristic,
as we have said, of a peculiarity in the literature of
the age, which have tended also to this result. We have
remarked that the first edition appeared in the days of
Hume, Robertson, and Adam Smith. None of these men
wrote for it, however.</p>
<p>In France the first intellects of the country were engaged
on their National Encyclop&aelig;dia, and mighty was the mischief
which they accomplished through its means; but
works of this character in Britain were left to authors of a
lower standing. Smollett once conducted a critical review;
Gilbert Stuart an Edinburgh magazine; Dr. Johnson drew
up parliamentary debates for two years together; Edmund
Burke toiled at the pages of an Annual Register; and
Goldsmith, early in his career, wrote letters for the newspapers.
But, like the apothecary in Shakespeare, it was
their &#8216;poverty, not their will, that consented;&#8217; and when
their fortunes brightened, these walks of obscure laboriousness
were left to what were deemed their legitimate
denizens&ndash;&ndash;mere mediocritists and compilers. A similar
feeling seems to have obtained regarding works of an encyclop&aelig;diacal
character. The authors of the first edition of
the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> were merely respectable compilers,&ndash;&ndash;we
know not that any of their names would now
sound familiar to the reader, with perhaps the exception of
that of Smellie, an Edinburgh writer of the last century,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
whose philosophical essays one sometimes meets with on our
bookstalls.</p>
<p>But among the other great changes produced by the
French Revolution, there was a striking and very important
change effected in our periodical literature. The old foundations
of society seemed breaking up, and the true nature
of that basis of opinion on which they had so long rested
came to be everywhere practically understood.</p>
<p>Minds of the larger order found it necessary to address
themselves direct to the people; and the newspaper, the
review, the magazine, the pamphlet, furnished them with
ready vehicles of conveyance. Archimedes, during the
siege of Syracuse, had to quit the sober quiet of his study,
and to mix with the armed defenders of his native city,
amid the wild confusion of sallies and assaults, the rocking
of beleaguered towers, the creaking of engines, and the
hurtling of missiles. It was thus with some of the greatest
minds of the country during the distraction and alarm of
the French Revolution. Coleridge conducted a newspaper;
Sir James Mackintosh wrote for one; Canning contributed
to the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i>; Robert Hall of Leicester became a
reviewer; Southey, Jeffrey, Brougham, Scott, Giffard, all
men in the first rank, appeared in the character of contributors
to the periodicals.</p>
<p>The aspect of this department of literature suddenly
changed, and the influence of that change survives to this
day. Even now, some of our first literary names are known
chiefly in their connection with magazines and reviews.
Men such as Macaulay and Sidney Smith have scarce any
place as authors dissociated from the <i>Edinburgh</i>; and
Lockhart and Wilson are most felt in the world of letters
in their connection with <i>Blackwood</i> and the <i>Quarterly</i>.
And this change affected more than the periodicals. Its
influence extended to works of the encyclop&aelig;diacal character.
The two great Encyclop&aelig;dias of Edinburgh&ndash;&ndash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
which bears the name of the city, and that whose name we
have placed at the head of this article&ndash;&ndash;came to reckon
among their contributors the first men of the kingdom,
both in science and literature: they benefited as greatly
by the change we describe as the periodicals themselves.
The Revolution, in its reflex influence, seems to have drawn
a line in the British encyclop&aelig;diacal field between the
labours of mere compilers and the achievements of original
authorship; and the peculiarity of plan in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i>, to which we have already referred&ndash;&ndash;that peculiarity
which gives an art or science entire as a treatise,
instead of breaking it down into as many separate articles
as it possesses technical terms&ndash;&ndash;enabled this work to avail
itself to the fullest extent of the improvement. No author,
however great his powers, can be profound in the compass
of a few paragraphs.</p>
<p>Goldsmith could assert that in an essay of a page or two
it is even a merit to be superficial; and few there are who
possess, with Goldsmith, the pure literary ability of being
superficial with good effect.</p>
<p>But it is not enough to say of this work that it is enriched
by contributions from not a few of the ablest writers which
the present century has produced. It should be added,
further, that it contains some of the masterpieces of these
men. No one ever excelled Sir James Mackintosh in philosophical
criticism. It was peculiarly his <i>forte</i>. He was
rather a great judge of metaphysical power than a metaphysician.
And yet it is this admirable critic who decides
that the exquisitely classical dissertation of Dugald Stewart,
written for this <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>, is the most magnificent of
that philosopher&#8217;s works; and remarks, in accounting for
the fact, that the &#8216;memorable instances of Cicero and
Milton, and still more those of Dryden and Burke, seem
to show that there is some natural tendency in the fire of
genius to burn more brightly, or to blaze more fiercely, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
the evening than in the morning of human life.&#8217; We are
mistaken if Sir James&#8217;s own contribution to this work does
not take decidedly a first place among his productions.
The present age has not produced a piece of more exquisitely
polished English, or of more tasteful or more nicely
discriminating criticism.</p>
<p>There is an occult beauty and elegance in some of his
thoughts and expressions, on which it is no small luxury
to repose,&ndash;&ndash;lines of reflection, too, along which one must
feel as well as think one&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>What can be finer, for instance, than his remarks on the
poetry of Dr. Thomas Brown, or what more thoroughly
removed from commonplace? He tells us how the philosophic
poet &#8216;observed man and his wider world with the
eye of a metaphysician;&#8217; that &#8216;the dark results of such contemplations,
when he reviewed them, often filled his soul
with feelings which, being both grand and melancholy,
were truly poetical;&#8217; that &#8216;unfortunately, however, few
readers can be touched with fellow-feeling;&#8217; for that &#8216;he
sings to few, and must be <i>content with sometimes moving a
string in the soul of the lonely visionary, who, in the daydreams
of youth, has felt as well as meditated on the mysteries
of nature</i>.&#8217; The dissertation of Playfair is also pitched on
the highest key to which that elegant writer ever attained.
If we except the unjust and offensive estimate of the powers
of Franklin, a similar judgment may be passed on the preliminary
dissertation of Sir John Leslie. Jeffrey&#8217;s famous
theory of beauty is, of all the philosophic pieces of that
accomplished writer, by far the most widely known; and
Sir Walter Scott&#8217;s essay on the drama is at least equal to
any of the serious prose compositions of its great author.
There is something peculiarly fascinating in the natural
history of this edition,&ndash;&ndash;a department wholly rewritten, and
furnished chiefly by the singularly pleasing pen of Mr. James
Wilson. It is not yet twenty years since Constable&#8217;s supplement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
to the last edition appeared; and yet in this province,
so mightily has the tide risen, that well-nigh all the
old lines of classification have been obliterated or covered
up. Vast additions have been also made. At no former
time was there half the amount of actual observation in
this field which exists in it now; and it is well that there
should be so skilful a workman as Mr. Wilson to avail himself
of the accumulating materials. His treatises show how
very just is the estimate of his powers given to the public
in <i>Peter&#8217;s Letters</i> considerably more than twenty years ago,
at a time when he was comparatively little known. But we
cannot enumerate a tithe of the masterpieces of the British
Encyclop&aelig;dia.</p>
<p>Judging from the list of contributors&#8217; names attached to
the index, we must hold that Moderatism in the field of
literature and science is very much at a discount. But
there is no lack of data of very various kinds to force upon
us <i>this</i> conclusion. Among our sound non-intrusionists we
find the names of Lord Jeffrey, Sir David Brewster, Professor
John Fleming, Professor David Welsh, Professor Anderson,
Dr. Irvine, the Rev. Mr. Hetherington, the Rev. Mr.
Omond, Mr. Alexander Dunlop, and Mr. Cowan; whereas
of all the opposite party who record their votes in our
church courts, we have succeeded in finding the name of
but a single individual, Dr. John Lee.</p>
<p>Why has Dr. Bryce thus left the field to the fanatics? had
he nothing to insert on missions? Or could not Mr. Robertson
of Ellon have been great on the article Beza?</p>
<p>Was there no exertion demanded of them to save the
credit of the Earl of Aberdeen&#8217;s learned clergy? One of
the main defects of omission in the work (of course we
merely mention the circumstance) is the omission of the
name of one very great non-intrusionist. Ethical and metaphysical
philosophy are represented by Dugald Stewart and
Sir James Mackintosh; mathematical and physical science
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
by Sir David Brewster, Sir John Leslie, Playfair, and Robinson;
political economy by Ricardo, M&#8217;Culloch, and Malthus;
natural history by James Wilson and Dr. Fleming;
Hazlitt and Haydon discourse on painting and the fine
arts; Jeffrey on the beautiful; Sir Walter Scott on chivalry,
the drama, and romance; the classical pen of Dr. Irvine
has illustrated what may be termed the biographical history
of Scotland; physiology finds a meet expounder in Dr.
Roget; geology in Mr. Phillips; medical jurisprudence in
Dr. Traill. But in whom does theology find an illustrator?
Does our country boast in the present age of no very eminent
name in this noble department of knowledge&ndash;&ndash;no
name known all over Scotland, Britain, Europe, Christendom&ndash;&ndash;a
name whom we may associate with that of Dugald
Stewart in ethical, or that of Sir David Brewster in physical
science? In utter ignorance of the facts, we can, as we
have said, but merely refer to the omission as one which
will be assuredly marked in the future, when the din and
dust of our existing controversies shall be laid, and when
all now engaged in them who are tall enough to catch the
eye of posterity, will be seen in their genuine colours and
their true proportions. The article Theology in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i> is written, not by Dr. Chalmers, but new-modelled
from an old article by the minister of an Independent
congregation in Edinburgh, Mr. Lindsay Alexander&ndash;&ndash;we
doubt not an able and good man, but not supereminently
the <i>one</i> theologian of Scotland.</p>
<p>We mark, besides, a few faults, of <i>commission</i> in the work,
apparently of a sub-editorial character, but which, unlike
the defect just pointed out, the editor of some future edition
will find little difficulty in amending. Works the production
of a single mind, bear generally an individual character;
works the productions of many minds, are marked rather
by the character of the age to which they belong. We find
occasional evidence in the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> that it belongs to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
the age of Catholic Emancipation,&ndash;&ndash;an age in which the <i>true</i>
in science was deemed a very great matter by men to whom
the <i>true</i> in religion seemed a much less one. One at least
of the minds employed on the minor articles of the work
had palpably a papistical leaning.</p>
<p>A blaze of eulogium, which contrasts ludicrously enough
with the well-toned sobriety of what we may term its staple
style, is made to surround, like the halo in old paintings,
some of the men who were happy enough to be distinguished
assertors of the Romish Church. We would instance, as a
specimen, the biographical sketches of Bossuet and the
Jesuit Bourdaloue, written by the late Dr. James Browne.
These, however, are but comparatively minute flaws in a
work so truly great, and of such immense multiplicity.
They are some of the imperfections of a work to which
imperfection is inevitable, and which, after all such deductions
have been made, must be recognised as by much the
least faulty and most complete of its class which the world
has yet seen.</p>

<p style="float:left; width:auto;">[<i>Private.</i>]</p><p style="float:right; width:auto;">&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;, <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Isle of Skye</span>.</p>
</div>
<p style="clear:both" >.... I know not when this may reach you. We are
much shut out from the world at this dead season of the
year, especially in those wilder solitudes of the island that
extend their long slopes of moor to the west. The vast
Atlantic spreads out before us, blackened by tempest, a
solitary waste, unenlivened by a single sail, and fenced off
from the land by an impassable line of breakers. Even
from the elevation where I now write&ndash;&ndash;for my little cottage
stands high on the hill-side&ndash;&ndash;I can hear the measured
boom of the waves, swelling like the roar of distant artillery,
above the melancholy moanings of the wind among the
nearer crags, and the hoarser dash of the stream in the
hollow below. We are in a state of siege: the isle is beleaguered
on its rugged line of western coast, and all communication
within that quarter cut off; while in the opposite
direction the broken and precarious footways that wind
across the hills to our more accessible eastern shores, are
still drifted over in the deeper hollows of the snow of the
last great storm. It was only yester-evening that my cousin
Eachen, with whom I share your newspaper, succeeded in
bringing me the number published early in the present
month, in which you furnish your readers with a report of
the great railway meeting at Glasgow.</p>
<p>My cousin and I live on opposite sides of the island.
We met at our tryst among the hills, not half an hour,
before sunset; and as each had far to walk back, and as a
storm seemed brewing&ndash;&ndash;for the wind had suddenly lowered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
and the thick mists came creeping down the hill-sides, all
dank and chill, and laden with frost-rime, that settled crisp
and white on our hair&ndash;&ndash;we deemed it scarce prudent to
indulge in our usual long conversation together.</p>
<p>&#8216;You will find,&#8217; said Eachen, as he handed me the
paper, &#8216;that things are looking no better. The old Tories
are going on in the old way, bitterer against the gospel than
ever. They will not leave us in all Skye a minister that
has ever been the means of converting a soul; and what
looks as ill, our great Scotch railway, that broke the Sabbath
last year, in the vain hope of making money by it, is to
break it this year at a dead loss. And this for no other
purpose that people can see, than just that an Edinburgh
writer may advertise his business by making smart speeches
about it. Depend on&#8217;t, Allister, the country&#8217;s <i>fey</i>.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;The old way of advertising,&#8217; said I, &#8216;before it became
necessary that an elder should have at least some show of
religion about him, was to get into the General Assembly,
and make speeches there. If the crisis comes, we shall see
the practice in full blow again. We shall see our anti-Sabbatarian
gentlemen transmuted into voluble Moderate
elders, talking hard for clients without subjecting themselves
to the advertisement duty,&ndash;&ndash;and the railway mayhap
keeping its Sabbaths.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Keeping its Sabbaths,&#8217; replied Eachen; &#8216;ay, but the
shareholders, perhaps, have little choice in the matter. I
wish you heard our catechist on that. Depend on&#8217;t,
Allister, the country&#8217;s <i>fey</i>.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Keeping its Sabbaths? Yes,&#8217; said I, catching at his
meaning, &#8216;if we are to be visited by a permanent commercial
depression&ndash;&ndash;and there are many things less likely
at the present time&ndash;&ndash;the railway <i>may</i> keep its Sabbaths,
and keep them as the land of Judea did of old. It would
be all too easy, in a period of general distress, to touch that
line of necessarily high expenditure below which it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
be ruin for the returns of the undertaking to fall. Let but
the invariably great outlay continue to exceed the income
for any considerable time, and the railway <i>must</i> keep its
Sabbaths.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Just the catechist&#8217;s idea,&#8217; rejoined my cousin. &#8216;He
spoke on the subject at our last meeting. &#8220;Eachen,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;Eachen, the thing lies so much in the ordinary
course of providence, that our blinded Sabbath-breakers,
were it to happen, would recognise only disaster in it, not
judgment. I see at times, with a distinctness that my
father would have called the second sight, that long weary
line of rail, with its Sabbath travellers of pleasure and
business speeding over it, and a crowd of wretched witnesses
raised, all unwittingly and unwillingly on their own
parts, to testify against it, and of coming judgment, at both
its ends. I see that the walks of the one great city into
which it opens are blackened by shoals of unemployed
artisans; and that the lanes and alleys of the other number
by thousands and tens of thousands their pale and hunger-bitten
operatives, that cry for work and food. They testify
all too surely that judgment needs no miracle here. Let
but the evil continue to grow&ndash;&ndash;nay, let but one of our
Scottish capitals, our great mart of commerce and trade
sink into the circumstances of its manufacturing neighbour
Paisley&ndash;&ndash;and the railway <i>must</i> keep its Sabbaths. But alas!
there would be no triumph for party in the case. Great,
ere the evil could befall, would the sufferings of the country
be, and they would be sufferings that would extend to all.&#8221;
What think you, Allister, of the catechist&#8217;s note?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Almost worth throwing into English,&#8217; I said. &#8216;But
the fog still thickens, and it will be dark night ere we reach
home.&#8217; And so we parted.</p>
<p>Dark night it was, and the storm had burst out. But it
was pleasant, when I had reached my little cottage, to pile
high the fire on the hearth, and to hear the blast roaring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
outside, and shaking the window-boards, as if some rude
hand were striving to unfasten them. I lighted my little
heap of moss fir on the projecting stone that serves the
poor Highlander for at once lamp and candlestick, and
bent me over your fourth page, to scan the Sabbath returns
of a Scottish railroad. But my rugged journey and the
beating of the storm had induced a degree of lassitude;
the wind outside, too, had forced back the smoke, until it
had filled with a drowsy, umbery atmosphere, the whole of
my dingy little apartment: Mr. M&#8217;Neill seemed considerably
less smart than usual, and more than ordinarily offensive,
and in the middle of his speech I fell fast asleep. The
scene changed, and I found myself still engaged in my late
journey, coming down over the hill, just as the sun was
setting red and lightless through the haze behind the dark
Atlantic. The dreary prospect on which I had looked so
shortly before was restored in all its features: there was the
blank, leaden-coloured sea, that seemed to mix all around
with the blank, leaden-coloured sky; the moors spread out
around me, brown and barren, and studded with rock and
stone; the fogs, as they crept downwards, were lowering
the overtopping screen of hills behind to one dead level.
Through the landscape, otherwise so dingy and sombre,
there ran one long line of somewhat brighter hue: it was
a long line of breakers tumbling against the coast far as
the eye could reach, and that seemed interposed as a sort
of selvage between the blank, leaden sea, and the deep,
melancholy russet of the land. Through one of those
changes so common in dreams, the continuous line of surf
seemed, as I looked, to alter its character. It winded no
longer round headland and bay, but stretched out through
the centre of the landscape, straight as an extended cord,
and the bright white saddened down to the fainter hue of
decaying vegetation. The entire landscape underwent a
change. Under the gloomy sky of a stormy evening, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
could mark on the one hand the dark blue of the Pentlands,
and on the other the lower slopes of Corstorphine.
Arthur&#8217;s Seat rose dim in the distance behind; and in
front, the pastoral valley of Wester Lothian stretched away
mile beyond mile, with its long rectilinear mound running
through the midst,&ndash;&ndash;from where I stood beside one of the
massier viaducts that rose an hundred feet overhead, till
where the huge bulk seemed diminished to a slender thread
on the far edge of the horizon.</p>
<p>It seemed as if years had passed&ndash;&ndash;many years. I had an
indistinct recollection of scenes of terror and of suffering,
of the shouts of maddened multitudes engaged in frightful
warfare, of the cries of famishing women and children,
of streets and lanes flooded with blood, of raging flames
enwrapping whole villages in terrible ruin, of the flashing
of arms and the roaring of artillery; but all was dimness
and confusion. The recollection was that of a dream remembered
in a dream. The solemn text was in my mind,
&#8216;Voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and a great earthquake,
such as was not since men were upon the earth, so
mighty an earthquake and so great;&#8217; and I now felt as if
the convulsion was over, and that its ruins lay scattered
around me. The railway, I said, is keeping its Sabbaths.
All around was solitary, as in the wastes of Skye. The
long rectilinear mound seemed shaggy with gorse and thorn,
that rose against the sides, and intertwisted their prickly
branches atop. The sloe-thorn, and the furze, and the
bramble choked up the rails. The fox rustled in the
brake; and where his track had opened up a way through
the fern, I could see the red and corroded bars stretching
idly across. There was a viaduct beside me: the flawed
and shattered masonry had exchanged its raw hues for a
crust of lichens; one of the taller piers, undermined by
the stream, had drawn two of the arches along with it,
and lay adown the water-course a shapeless mass of ruin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
o&#8217;ermasted by flags and rushes. A huge ivy, that had
taken root under a neighbouring pier, threw up its long
pendulous shoots over the summit. I ascended to the top.
Half-buried in furze and sloe-thorn, there rested on the rails
what had once been a train of carriages; the engine ahead
lay scattered in fragments, the effect of some disastrous
explosion, and damp, and mould, and rottenness had done
their work on the vehicles behind. Some had already
fallen to pieces, so that their places could be no longer
traced in the thicket that had grown up around them;
others stood comparatively entire, but their bleached and
shrivelled panels rattled to the wind, and the mushroom
and the fungus sprouted from between their joints. The
scene bore all too palpably the marks of violence and
bloodshed. There was an open space in front, where the
shattered fragments of the engine lay scattered; and here
the rails had been torn up by violence, and there stretched
across, breast-high, a rudely piled rampart of stone. A
human skeleton lay atop, whitened by the winds; there
was a broken pike beside it; and, stuck fast in the naked
skull, which had rolled to the bottom of the rampart, the
rusty fragment of a sword. The space behind resembled
the floor of a charnel-house&ndash;&ndash;bindwood and ground-ivy lay
matted over heaps of bones; and on the top of the hugest
heap of all, a skull seemed as if grinning at the sky from
amid the tattered fragments of a cap of liberty. Bones lay
thick around the shattered vehicles; a trail of skeletons
dotted the descending bank, and stretched far into a neighbouring
field; and from amid the green rankness that shot
up around them, I could see soiled and tattered patches of
the British scarlet. A little farther on there was another
wide gap in the rails. I marked beside the ruins of a
neighbouring hovel a huge pile of rusty bars, and there lay
inside the fragment of an uncouth cannon marred in the
casting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>I wandered on in unhappiness, oppressed by that feeling
of terror and disconsolateness so peculiar to one&#8217;s more
frightful dreams. The country seemed everywhere a desert.
The fields were roughened with tufts of furze and broom;
hedgerows had shot up into lines of stunted trees, with
wide gaps interposed; cottage and manor-house had alike
sunk into ruins; here the windows still retained their
shattered frames, and the roof-tree lay rotting amid the
dank vegetation of the floor; yonder the blackness of fire
had left its mark, and there remained but reddened and
mouldering stone. Wild animals and doleful creatures had
everywhere increased. The toad puffed out his freckled
sides on hearths whose fires had been long extinguished,
the fox rustled among its bushes, the masterless dog howled
from the thicket, the hawk screamed shrill and sharp as it
fluttered overhead. I passed what had been once the
policies of a titled proprietor. The trees lay rotting and
blackened among the damp grass&ndash;&ndash;all except one huge
giant of the forest, that, girdled by the axe half a man&#8217;s
height from the ground, and scorched by fire, stretched
out its long dead arms towards the sky. In the midst of
this wilderness of desolation lay broken masses, widely
scattered, of what had been once the mansion-house. A
shapeless hollow, half filled with stagnant water, occupied
its immediate site; and the earth was all around
torn up, as if battered with cannon. The building had
too obviously owed its destruction to the irresistible force
of gunpowder.</p>
<p>There was a parish church on the neighbouring eminence,
and it, too, was roofless and a ruin. Alas! I exclaimed,
as I drew aside the rank stalks of nightshade and
hemlock that hedged up the breach in the wall through
which I passed into the interior&ndash;&ndash;alas! have the churches
of Scotland also perished? The inscription of a mutilated
tombstone that lay outside caught my eye, and I paused
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
for a moment&#8217;s space in the gap to peruse it. It was an
old memorial of the times of the Covenant, and the legend
was more than half defaced. I succeeded in deciphering
merely a few half sentences&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;killing-time,&#8217; &#8216;faithful
martyr,&#8217; &#8216;bloody Prelates;&#8217; and beneath there was a fragmentary
portion of the solemn text, &#8216;How long, O Lord,
holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood?&#8217;
I stepped into the interior: the scattered remains of an
altar rested against the eastern gable. There was a crackling
as of broken glass under my feet, and stooping down
I picked up a richly-stained fragment: it bore a portion of
that much-revered sign, the pelican giving her young to eat
of her own flesh and blood&ndash;&ndash;the sign which Puseyism and
Popery equally agree in regarding as adequately expressive
of their doctrine of the real presence, and which our Scottish
Episcopalians have so recently adopted as the characteristic
vignette of their service-book. The toad and the
newt had crept over it, and it had borrowed a new tint of
brilliancy from the slime of the snail. Destruction had
run riot along the walls of this parish church. There were
carvings chipped and mutilated, as if in sport, less apparently
with the intention of defacing, than rendering them
contemptible and grotesque. A huge cross of stone had
been reared over the altar, and both the top and one of the
arms had been struck away, and from the surviving arm
there dangled a noose. The cross had been transformed
into a gibbet. Nor were there darker indications wanting.
In a recess set apart as a cabinet for relics, there were
human bones all too fresh to belong to a remote antiquity;
and in a niche under the gibbet lay the tattered remains of
a surplice dabbled in blood. I stood amid the ruins, and
felt a sense of fear and horror creeping over me: the air
darkened under the scowl of the coming tempest and the
closing night, and the wind shrieked more mournfully amid
the shattered and dismantled walls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>There came another change over my dream. I found
myself wandering in darkness, I knew not whither, among
bushes and broken ground; there was the roar of a large
stream in my ear, and the savage howl of the storm. I
retain a confused, imperfect recollection of a light streaming
upon broken water&ndash;&ndash;of a hard struggle in a deep ford&ndash;&ndash;and
of at length sharing in the repose and safety of a cottage,
solitary and humble almost as my own. The vision again
strengthened, and I found myself seated beside a fire, and
engaged with a few grave and serious men in singing the
evening psalm, with which they closed for the time their
services of social devotion.</p>
<p>&#8216;The period of trial wears fast away,&#8217; said one of the
number, when all was over&ndash;&ndash;a grey-haired, patriarchal-looking
old man&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;The period of trial is well-nigh over,
the storms of our long winter are past, and we have survived
them all. Patience! a little more patience, and we shall see
the glorious spring-time of the world begin! The vial is at
length exhausted.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;How very simple,&#8217; said one of the others, as if giving expression
rather to the reflection that the remark suggested,
than speaking in reply,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;how exceedingly simple now it
seems to trace to their causes the decline and fall of Britain!
The ignorance and the irreligion of the land have fully
avenged themselves, and have been consumed in turn in
fires of their own kindling. How could even mere men of
the world have missed seeing the great moral evil that lay
at the root of&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; said a well-known voice that half mingled with
my dreaming fancies, half recalled me to consciousness;
&#8216;nothing can be plainer, Donald. That lawyer-man is
evidently not making his smart speeches or writing his
clever circulars with an eye to the pecuniary interests of
the railroad. No person can know better than he knows
that the company are running their Sabbath trains at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
sacrifice of some four or five thousand a year. Were there
not a hundred thousand that took the pledge? and can it
be held by any one that knows Scotland, that they aren&#8217;t
worth over-head a shilling a year to the railway? No, no;
depend on&#8217;t, the man is guiltless of any design of making
the shareholders rich by breaking the Sabbath. He is
merely supporting a desperate case in the eye of the
country, and getting into all the newspapers, that people
may see how clever a fellow he is. He is availing himself
of the principle that makes men in our great towns go
about with placards set up on poles, and with bills printed
large stuck round their hats.&#8217;</p>
<p>Two of my nearer neighbours, who had travelled a long
mile through the storm to see whether I had got my newspaper,
had taken their seats beside me when I was engaged
with my dream; and after reading your railway report, they
were now busied in discussing the various speeches and
their authors. My dream is, I am aware, quite unsuited
for your columns, and yet I send it to you. There are
none of its pictured calamities that lie beyond the range of
possibility&ndash;&ndash;nay, there are perhaps few of them that at this
stage may not actually be feared; but if so, it is at least
equally sure that there can be none of them that at this
stage might not be averted.</p>

<h2>THE TWO MR. CLARKS.</h2>
</div>
<p>Among the some six or eight and twenty volumes of
pamphlets which have been already produced by our
Church controversy, and which bid fair to compose but a
part of the whole, there is one pamphlet, in the form of a
Sermon, which bears date January 1840, and two other
pamphlets, in the form of Dialogues, which bear date April
1843. The Sermon and the Dialogues discuss exactly the
same topics. They are written in exactly the same style.
They exhibit, in the same set phrases, the same large
amount of somewhat obtrusive sanctimoniousness. They
are equally strong in the same confidence of representing,
on their respective subjects, the true mind of Deity. They
solicit the same circle of readers; they seem to have employed
the same fount of types; they have emanated from
the same publishers. They are liker, in short, than the
twin brothers in Shakespeare&#8217;s <i>Comedy of Errors</i>; and the
only material dissimilarity which we have been yet able to
discover is, that whereas the Sermon is a thorough-going
and uncompromising defence of our Evangelical majority
in the Church, the Dialogues form an equally thorough-going
and uncompromising attack upon them. This, however,
compared with the numerous points of verisimilitude,
the reader will, we are sure, deem but a trifle, especially
when he has learned further that they represent the same
mind, and have employed the same pen&ndash;&ndash;that the Sermon
was published by the Rev. Alexander Clark of Inverness in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
1840, and the Dialogues by the Rev. Alexander Clark of
Inverness in 1843.</p>
<p>We spent an hour at the close of twilight a few evenings
ago, in running over the Sermon and the Dialogues, and in
comparing them, as we went along, paragraph by paragraph,
and sentence by sentence. We had before us also one of
Mr. Clark&#8217;s earlier publications, his <i>Rights of Members of the
Church of Scotland</i>, and a complete collection of his anti-patronage
speeches for a series of years, as recorded in <i>The
Church Patronage Reporter</i>, with his speech &#8216;anent lay
patronage&#8217; in the General Assembly, when in 1833 he led
the debate on the popular side. The publications, in all,
extended over a period of fourteen years. They exhibited
Mr. Clark, and what Mr. Clark had held, in 1829, in 1831,
in 1832, in 1836, in 1840, and in 1843. We found that we
could dip down upon him, as we went along, like a sailor
taking soundings in the reaches of some inland frith or some
navigable river, and ascertain by year and day the exact
state of his opinions, and whether they were rising or falling
at the time. And our task, if a melancholy, was certainly
no uninteresting one. We succeeded in bringing to the
surface, from out of the oblivion that had closed over them,
many a curious, glittering, useless little thing, somewhat
resembling the decayed shells and phosphoric jellies that
attach themselves to the bottom of the deep-sea lead. Here
we found the tale of a peroration, set as if on joints, that
clattered husky and dry like the rattles of a snake; there an
argument sprouting into green declamation, like a damaged
ear of corn in a wet harvest; yonder a piece of delightful
egotism, set full in sentiment like a miniature of Mr. Clark
in a tinsel frame. What seemed most remarkable, however,
in at least his earlier productions, was their ceaseless glitter
of surface, if we may so speak. We found them literally
sprinkled over with little bits of broken figures, as if the
reverend gentleman had pounded his metaphors and comparisons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
in a mortar, and then dusted them over his style.
It is thus, thought we, that our manufacturers of fancy wax
deal by their mica. In his <i>Rights of Members</i>, for instance,
we found in one page that &#8216;the gross errors of Romanism
had risen <i>in successive tides</i>, until the <i>light of truth suffered a
fearful eclipse</i> during a long period of darkness;&#8217; and we had
scarce sufficiently admired the sublime height of tides that
occasion eclipses, when we were further informed, in the
page immediately following, that the god of this world was
mustering his <i>multifarious hosts for the battle</i>, hoping, <i>amidst
the waves</i> of popular commotion, &#8216;to <i>blot out the name</i> of God
from the British Constitution.&#8217; Assuredly, thought we, we
have the elements of no commonplace engagement here.
&#8216;Multifarious hosts,&#8217; fairly mustered, and &#8216;battling&#8217; amid
&#8216;waves&#8217; in &#8216;commotion&#8217; to &#8216;blot out a name,&#8217; would be a
sight worth looking at, even though, like the old shepherd
in the <i>Winter&#8217;s Tale</i>, their zeal should lack footing amid the
waters. But though detained in the course of our search
by the happinesses of the reverend gentleman, we felt that it
was not with the genius of Mr. Clark that we had specially
to do, but with his consistency.</p>
<p>For eleven of the fourteen years over which our materials
extended, we found the Rev. Mr. Clark one of the most
consistent of men. From his appearance on the platform
at Aberdeen in 1829, when he besought his audience not to
deem it obtrusive in a stranger that he ventured to address
them, and then elicited their loud applauses by soliciting
their prayers for &#8216;one minister labouring in northern parts,&#8217;
who &#8216;aspired to no higher distinction on earth than that he
should spend and be spent in the service of his dear Lord
and Master,&#8217; down to 1840, when he published his sermon
on the &#8216;Present Position of the Church, and the Duty of
its Members,&#8217; and urged, with the solemnity of an oath, that
&#8216;the Church of Scotland was engaged in asserting principles
which the allegiance it owes to Christ would never permit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
it to desert,&#8217; Mr. Clark stood forward on every occasion the
uncompromising champion of spiritual independence, and
of the rights of the Christian people. He took his place far
in the van. He was no mere half-and-half non-intrusionist,&ndash;&ndash;no
complaisant eulogist of the Veto,&ndash;&ndash;no timid doubter
that the Church in behalf of her people might possibly
stretch her powers too far, and thus separate her temporalities
from her cures. Nothing could be more absurd, he
asserted, than to imagine such a thing. On parade day,
when she stood resting on her arms in the sunshine, Mr.
Clark was fugleman to his party,&ndash;&ndash;not merely a front man
in the front rank, but a man far in advance of the front
rank. Nay, even after the collision had taken place, Mr.
Clark could urge on his brethren that all that was necessary
to secure them the victory was just to go a little further
ahead, and deprive their refractory licentiates of their
licences. We found that for eleven of the fourteen years,
as we have said, Mr. Clark was uniformly consistent. But
in the twelfth year the conflict became actually dangerous,
and Mr. Clark all at once dropped his consistency. The
great suddenness&ndash;&ndash;the extreme abruptness&ndash;&ndash;of the change,
gave to it the effect of a trick of legerdemain. The conjurer
puts a pigeon into an earthen pipkin, gives the vessel
a shake, and then turns it up, and lo! out leaps the little
incarcerated animal, no longer a pigeon, but a rat. It was
thus with the Rev. Mr. Clark. Adversity, like Vice in the
fable, took upon herself the character of a juggler, and
stepping full into the middle of the Church question, began
to play at cup and ball. Nothing, certainly, could be more
wonderful than the transformations she effected; and the
special transformation effected on the Rev. Mr. Clark surpassed
in the marvellous all the others. She threw the
reverend gentleman into a box, gave him a smart shake,
and then flung him out again, and lo! to the astonishment
of all men, what went in Mr. Clark, came out Mr. Bisset of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
Bourtie. In order, apparently, that so great a marvel should
not be lost to the world, Mr. Clark has been at no little
trouble in showing himself, both before he went in and
since he came out. His pamphlet of 1840 and his pamphlets
of 1843 represent him in the two states: we see him
going about in them, all over the country, to the extent of
their circulation, like the mendicant piper in his go-cart,&ndash;&ndash;making
open proclamation everywhere, &#8216;I am the man wot
changed;&#8217; and the only uncomfortable feeling one has in
contemplating them as curiosities, arises solely from the air
of heavy sanctity that pervades equally all their diametrically
opposed doctrines, contradictory assertions, and contending
views, as if Deity could declare equally for truth
and error, just as truth and error chanced to be held by Mr.
Clark. Of so solemn a cast are the reverend gentleman&#8217;s
belligerent pamphlets, that they serve to remind one of
antagonist witnesses swearing point blank in one another&#8217;s
faces at the Old Bailey.</p>
<p>Such were some of the thoughts which arose in our mind
when spending an hour all alone with the Rev. Mr Clark&#8217;s
pamphlets. We bethought us of an Eastern story about a
very wicked prince who ruined the fair fame of his brother,
by assuming his body just as he might his greatcoat, and
then doing a world of mischief under the cover of his name
and appearance. What, thought we, if this, after all, be
but a trick of a similar character? Dr. Bryce has been
long in Eastern parts, and knows doubtless a great deal
about the occult sciences. We would not be much surprised
should it turn out, that having injected himself into
the framework of the Rev. Mr. Clark, he is now making
the poor man appear grossly inconsistent, and both an
Erastian and an Intrusionist, simply by acting through the
insensate carcase. The veritable Mr. Clark may be lying
in deep slumber all this while in the ghost cave of Munlochy,
like one of the seven sleepers of Ephesus, or standing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
entranced, under the <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'inflences'">influences</ins> of fairy-land, in some
bosky recess of the haunted Tomnahurich. We must just
glance over these Dialogues again, and see whether we
cannot detect Dr. Bryce in them.</p>
<p>And glance over them we did. There could be no
denying that the Doctor was there, and this in a much
more extreme shape than he ever yet wore in his own
proper person. Dr. Bryce asserts, for instance, in his
speeches and pamphlets, that the liberty for which the
Church has been contending is a liberty incompatible with
her place and standing as an Establishment&ndash;&ndash;and there he
stops; but we found him asserting in Mr. Clark&#8217;s Dialogues,
that it is a liberty at once so dangerous and illegal,
that Voluntaries must not be permitted to enjoy it either.
We saw various other points equally striking as we went
along. Our attention, however, was gradually drawn to
another matter. The <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> to which the reader
is introduced are a minister and two of his parishioners,
the one a Moderate, the other a Convocationist. It is
intended, of course, that the clerical gentleman should
carry the argument all his own way; and we could not help
admiring how, with an eye to this result, the writer had
succeeded in making the parishioners so amazingly superficial
in their information, and so ingeniously obtuse in
their intellects. They had both been called into existence
with the intention of being baffled and beaten, and made,
with a wise adaptation of means to the desired end, consummate
blockheads for the express purpose. &#8216;A man is a
much nobler animal than a lion,&#8217; said the woodman in the
fable to the shaggy king of the forest; &#8216;and if you but
come to yonder temple with me, I will show you, in proof
of the fact, the statue of a man lording it over the statue
of a prostrate lion.&#8217; &#8216;Aha!&#8217; said the shaggy king of the
forest in reply, &#8216;but was the sculptor a lion? Let us
lions become sculptors, and then we will show you lions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
lording it over prostrate men.&#8217; In Mr. Clark&#8217;s argumentative
Dialogues, Mr. Clark is the sculptor. It is really
refreshing, however, in these days of cold ingratitude, to see
how the creatures called into existence by his pen draw
round him, and sing <i>Io P&aelig;ans</i> in his praise. A brace of
Master Slenders attend the great Justice Shallow, who has
been literally the making of them; and when at his bidding
they engage with him in mimic warfare, they but pelt
him with roses, or sprinkle him over with <i>eau de Cologne</i>.
&#8216;Ah,&#8217; thought we, &#8216;had we but the true Mr. Clark here
to take a part in this fray&ndash;&ndash;the Mr. Clark who published
the great non-intrusion sermon, and wrote the <i>Rights of
Members</i>, and spoke all the long anti-patronage speeches,
and led the debate in the Assembly anent the rights of the
people, and declared it clear as day that the Church had
power to enact the Veto,&ndash;&ndash;had we but him here, he would
be the man to fight this battle. It would be no such
child&#8217;s play to grapple with him. Unaccustomed as we are
to lay wagers, we would stake a hundred pounds to a groat
on the true Mr. Clark!&#8217;</p>
<p>The twilight had fallen, the flames rose blue and languid
in the grate, the deep shadows flickered heavily on
the walls and ceiling; there was a drowsy influence in the
hour, and a still drowsier influence in the Dialogues, and
we think&ndash;&ndash;for what followed could have been only a dream&ndash;&ndash;we
think we must have fallen asleep. At all events, the
scene changed without any exertion on our part, and we
found ourselves in a quiet retired spot in the vicinity of
Inverness. The &#8216;hill of the ship,&#8217; that monarch of Fairy
Tomhans, rose immediately in front, gaily feathered over
with larch and forest trees; and, terminating a long vista
in the background, we saw Mr. Clark&#8217;s West Kirk, surmounted
by a vast weathercock of gilded tin. Ever and
anon the bauble turned its huge side to the sun, and the
reflected light went dancing far and wide athwart the landscape.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
Immediately beneath the weathercock there flared
an immense tablet, surmounted by a leaden Fame, and
bordered by a row of gongs and trumpets, which bore,
in three-feet letters, that, &#8216;in order to secure so valuable
an addition to the church accommodation of the parish,
the Rev. Mr. Clark had not hesitated, on his own personal
risk, to guarantee the payment of three thousand pounds.&#8217;
Our eyes were at first so dazzled by the blaze of the lackering&ndash;&ndash;for
the characters shone to the sun as if on fire&ndash;&ndash;that
we could see nothing else. As we gazed more attentively,
however, we could perceive that every stone and slate of
the building bore, like the tablet, the name of Mr. Clark.
The endless repetition presented the appearance of a churchyard
inscription viewed through a multiplying glass; but
what most astonished us was that the Gothic heads, carved
by pairs beside the labelled windows, opened wide their
stony lips from time to time, and shouted aloud, in a voice
somewhat resembling that of the domestic duck when she
breaks out into sudden clamour in a hot, dry day, &#8216;Clark,
Clark, Clark!&#8217; We stood not a little appalled at these
wonders, marvelling what was to come next, when lo! one
of the thickets of the Tomhan beside us opened its interlaced
and twisted branches, and out stepped the likeness
of Mr. Clark, attired like a conjurer, and armed with a rod.
His portly bulk was enwrapped in a voluminous scarf of
changing-coloured silk, that, when it caught the light in
one direction, exhibited the deep scarlet of a cardinal&#8217;s
mantle, and presented, when it caught it in another, the
sober tinge of our Presbyterian blue. Like the cloak of
Asmodeus, it was covered over with figures. In one corner
we could see the General Assembly done in miniature, and
Mr. Clark rising among the members like Gulliver in Lilliput,
to move against the deposition of the seven ministers
of Strathbogie. In another the same reverend gentleman,
drawn on the same large scale, was just getting on his legs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
at a political dinner, to denounce his old friends and allies
the Evangelicals, as wild destructives, &#8216;engaged in urging
on the fall of the Establishment, in the desperation of
human pride.&#8217; Here we could see him baptizing the child
of a person who, as he had fallen out of church-going
habits, could get it baptized nowhere else; there examined
in his presbytery for the offence with closed doors; yonder
writing letters to the newspapers on the subject, to say
that, if he <i>had</i> baptized the man&#8217;s child, it was all because
the man was, like himself, a good hater of forced settlements.
There were a great many other vignettes besides;
and the last in the series was the scene enacted at the late
Inverness Presbytery, when Mr. Clark rose to congratulate
his old associates, in all the stern severity of consistent
virtue, on the facile and &#8216;<i>squeezable</i>&#8217; character of their
representative for the Assembly.</p>
<p>The conjurer came out into an open space, drew a circle
around him, and then began to build up on the sward two
little human figures about three feet high, as boys build
up figures of snow at the commencement of a thaw. Harlequin
performs a somewhat similar feat in one of the
pantomimes. He first sets up two carrots on end, to serve
for legs; balances on them the head of a large cabbage, to
serve for a body; sticks on two other carrots, to serve for
arms; places a round turnip between them, to serve for a
head; gives the crazy erection a blow with his lath sword,
and straightway off it stalks, a vegetable man. Mr. Clark
had, in like manner, no sooner built up his figures, than,
with a peculiarly bland air, and in tones of the softest
liquidity, he whispered into the ear of the one, Be you a
Convocationist, and into that of the other, Be you a Moderate;
and then with his charmed rod he tapped them across
the shoulders, and set them a-walking. The creatures
straightway jerked up their little heads to the angle of his
face, bowed like a brace of automaton dancing-masters,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
and after pacing round his knees for a few seconds, began
Dialogue the first, in just the set terms in which we had
been reading it beside our own fire not half an hour before.
It seemed, for a few seconds, as if the conjurer and his
creations had joined together in a trio, to celebrate the
conjurer&#8217;s own praises. &#8216;Excellent clergyman!&#8217; said the
Convocationist. &#8216;Incomparable man!&#8217; exclaimed the
Moderate. &#8216;No minister like our minister!&#8217; said the two
in a breath. &#8216;Ah, gentlemen,&#8217; said the conjurer, looking
modestly down, &#8216;even my very enemies never venture to
deny that.&#8217; &#8216;You, sir,&#8217; said the Convocationist, &#8216;bring on
no occasion the Church question to the pulpit; you know
better&ndash;&ndash;you have more sense: we have quite as much of
the Church question as is good for us through the week.&#8217;
&#8216;For you, sir,&#8217; chimed in the Moderate, &#8216;I have long
cherished the most thorough respect; but as for your old
party, I dislike them more than ever.&#8217; &#8216;I am not mercenary,
gentlemen,&#8217; said the conjurer, laying his hand on
his breast; &#8216;I am not timid, I am not idle; I am a generous,
diligent, dauntless, attached pastor; I give alms of
all I possess&ndash;&ndash;in especial to the public charities; I make
long prayers,&ndash;&ndash;my very best friends often urge on me that
my vast labours, weekly and daily, are undermining my
strength; I fast often,&ndash;&ndash;I have guaranteed the payment of
three thousand pounds for the West Kirk, and three-fourths
of my stipend have gone this year to the liquidation of self-imposed
liabilities. True, I will be <i>eventually repaid</i>,&ndash;&ndash;that
is, if my people don&#8217;t leave me; <i>but I have no other security
beyond my confidence in the goodness of the cause, and the continued
liberality of my countrymen</i>.&#8217; And in this style would
the reverend gentleman have continued down to the bottom
of the fifth page in his first Dialogue, had it not been for
a singularly portentous and terrible interruption.</p>
<p>The haunted Tomnahurich rose, as we have said, immediately
behind us, leafy and green; and not one of its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
multitude of boughs trembled in the sunshine. Suddenly,
however, the hill-side began to move. There was a low
deep noise like distant thunder; and straightway the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
of a landslip came rolling downwards, half obliterating in
its course the circle of the conjurer. Turf, and clay, and
stone lay in a mingled ruin at our feet; and wriggling in
the midst, like a huge blue-bottle in an old cobweb, there
was a reverend gentleman dressed in black. He gathered
himself up, sprung deftly to his feet, and stood fronting the
conjurer. Wonderful to relate, the man in black proved to
be the veritable Mr. Clark of three years ago&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Clark
of 1840&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Clark who published the great non-intrusion
discourse, who wrote the <i>Rights of Members</i>, who spoke
the long anti-patronage speeches, who led the debate in
the Assembly anent the rights of the people, and who
declared it clear as day that the Church had power to
enact the Veto. The conjurer started backwards like a
man who receives a mortal wound: the two little figures
uttered a thin scrannel shriek apiece, and then slunk out of
existence. &#8216;Avoid ye,&#8217; exclaimed the conjurer, &#8216;Avoid ye!
<i>Conjuro te, conjuro te!</i>&#8217; He then went on to mutter, as
if by way of exorcism, in low and very rapid tones, &#8216;I have
no anxiety to refute the charge of inconsistency, which
some have endeavoured to fasten on me, from detached
portions of what I have written or spoken, during several
years, on what may be termed Church politics. In matters
not essential to salvation, increased light or advanced experience
may properly produce change of sentiment in the
most enlightened and conscientious Christian. For a man
to assert that he is subject to no change, is to lay claim to
one of the perfections&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8217; <i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 6.</p>
<p>&#8216;And so you won&#8217;t go out,&#8217; said the true Mr. Clark, interrupting
him.</p>
<p>&#8216;No, sir,&#8217; replied the conjurer. &#8216;I have maturely considered
the proposed secession from the Established Church,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
and, without pronouncing any judgment on the motives or
doings of others who may think or act differently, I deeply
feel that in such a measure I could not join without manifest
sin against the light of my conscience.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 4.</p>
<p>&#8216;Ah,&#8217; rejoined the true Mr. Clark, &#8216;did I not say it would
be so? I knew there would be found a set of recreant
priests, who, for a pitiful morsel of the world&#8217;s bread, would
submit to be the instruments of trampling on the blood-bought
rights of the Scottish people, and call themselves a
Church, while departing from their allegiance to Him who is
the source of all true ecclesiastical authority; but never can
these constitute the Church of Scotland!&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 40.</p>
<p>&#8216;I cannot reconcile it with the views I have long entertained
of my duty to the Church and to the country,&#8217; said
the conjurer, &#8216;to secede from the National Establishment,
simply because it wants what it wanted when I became one
of its ministers.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 12.</p>
<p>&#8216;Wanted when you became one of its ministers!&#8217; exclaimed
the true Mr. Clark. &#8216;No, sir. The civil courts
are now compelling obedience in cases in which they have
no jurisdiction, and have levelled with the ground the independent
jurisdiction of the Church,&ndash;&ndash;a Church bearing
in its diadem a host of martyrs, and which never hitherto
submitted to the supremacy of any power, excepting that
of the Son of God.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, pp. 59-63.</p>
<p>&#8216;I won&#8217;t go out,&#8217; reiterated the conjurer.</p>
<p>&#8216;Well, you have told me what you have long deemed to
be your duty,&#8217; said the true Mr. Clark. &#8216;I shall repeat to
you, in turn, what I three years ago recorded as mine. &#8220;It
is the duty of the Church,&#8221; I said, &#8220;to maintain its position,
confirmed as it is by solemn statutes and by the faith of
national treaties, until that shall be overthrown by the
deliberate decision of the State itself. Should such a circumstance
really occur, as that the Legislature should insist
that the Church holds its endowments on the express condition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
of its rendering to civil authority the subjection
which it can consistently yield to Christ alone, there being
then a plain violation of the terms on which the Church
entered into alliance with the State, that alliance must be
dissolved, as one which can be no longer continued, but by
rendering to men what is due to God.&#8217;&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 28.</p>
<p>&#8216;I deny entirely and <i>in toto</i>,&#8217; said the conjurer, &#8216;that the
present controversy involves the doctrine of the Headship.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>See
2d Dialogue</i>.</p>
<p>&#8216;Admit,&#8217; said the true Mr. Clark, &#8216;but the right of secular
courts to review, and thus to confirm or annul, the proceedings
of the Scottish Church in one of the most important
spiritual functions, and the same power may soon
be, under various pretexts, used to control all the inferior
departments of its ecclesiastical procedure. Will any man
say that a society thus acknowledging the supremacy of a
different power from that of Christ is any longer to be regarded
as a branch of the Church whose unity chiefly exists
in adherence to Him as its Head?&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 45.</p>
<p>&#8216;The claim,&#8217; said the conjurer, &#8216;is essentially Papal.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue
2d</i>, p. 6.</p>
<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; replied the true Mr. Clark, &#8216;not Papal, but Protestant:
our confessors and martyrs chose to suffer for it
the loss of all their worldly goods, and to incur the pains of
death in its most appalling forms.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 45.</p>
<p>&#8216;Papal notwithstanding,&#8217; reiterated the conjurer. &#8216;But
it is not to be wondered at, that in the earliest stages of
the Reformation, men newly come out of the Church of
Rome should have been led to assert for the office-bearers
of their Church the prerogatives which Romanism claimed
for her own.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 2d</i>, p. 7.</p>
<p>&#8216;What!&#8217; exclaimed the true Mr. Clark, &#8216;is not the present
contest clearly for the rights of the members of Christ,&ndash;&ndash;rights
manifestly recognised in His word, and involving
His Headship?&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 37. <i>See also</i> p. 31.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Not at all,&#8217; replied the conjurer. &#8216;The question is one
of faction, and of faction only. Struggles for the victory of
mere parties have been as injurious to vital godliness in the
Church as the same cause has been to the true prosperity
of the State.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 15.</p>
<p>&#8216;Faction!&#8217; exclaimed the true Mr. Clark; &#8216;the Church of
Scotland is now engaged in asserting principles which the
allegiance it owes to Christ will never permit it to desert.
And let it be rung in the ears of the people of Scotland,
that the great reason why the asserting of the Church&#8217;s
spiritual jurisdiction is so clamorously condemned in certain
quarters, is because it is employed to maintain the rights of
the people.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, pp. 37-39.</p>
<p>&#8216;To be above the authority of the law, no Church in this
country can be,&#8217; said the conjurer. &#8216;The Church courts
would be able, were their principles fully recognised, to
tread under foot the rights of the people as effectually as ever
they resisted those of patrons.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, pp. 14 and 16.</p>
<p>&#8216;Nothing can be more absurd than such insinuations,&#8217;
exclaimed the true Mr. Clark. &#8216;The Church disclaims every
kind of civil authority, and simply requires that there be
no interference on the part of civil rulers with its spiritual
functions. How that which declines a jurisdiction in civil
matters, can in any sense of the word, or in any conceivable
circumstances, be injurious to civil liberty, it is impossible
to conceive.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 32.</p>
<p>&#8216;Alas,&#8217; said the conjurer, &#8216;if the Church by recent events
has been exhibited in a lower position than Scotsmen ever
saw it placed in before, this has been occasioned by the
unhappy attitude of defiance of the civil tribunals in which
it was unadvisedly placed, and which no body, however
venerable, can be permitted to occupy with impunity in a
well-governed country.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 12.</p>
<p>&#8216;Degradation!&#8217; indignantly exclaimed the true Mr. Clark;
&#8216;did the Church, in consequence of the findings of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
civil courts, proceed to act in opposition to what it believes
and has solemnly declared to be founded on the Scripture,
and agreeable thereto, it would exhibit itself to the world
a disgraced and degraded society, utterly fallen from the
faithfulness to religious duty which marked former periods
of its history.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 21.</p>
<p>&#8216;Clear it is,&#8217; said the conjurer, &#8216;that the Church must
not be permitted to retain with impunity her attitude of
defiance to the civil tribunals. Were it otherwise, an
ecclesiastical power might come to be established in this
kingdom, fully able to trample uncontrolled on the most
sacred rights of the nation.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 12.</p>
<p>&#8216;Nothing, I repeat,&#8217; said the true Mr. Clark, &#8216;can be
more absurd than the insinuation. The liberties of the
Church of Scotland have been often assailed by the civil
authorities of the land, but uniformly by those who were
equally hostile to the civil freedom of the country. Its
rights were, during one dreary period, so effectually overthrown,
that none stood up to assert them but the devoted
band who, in the wildest fastnesses of their country, were
often compelled by the violence of military rule to water
with their blood the moors, where they rendered homage to
the King of Zion; while, in the sunshine of courtly favour,
ecclesiastics moved, who without fear bartered, for their
own sordid gain, the blood-bought liberties of the Church
of God, and showed themselves as willing to subvert the
civil rights of their countrymen as they had been to destroy
their religious privileges.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 30.</p>
<p>&#8216;To be above the law,&#8217; reiterated the conjurer, &#8216;no
Church in this country can be.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 16.</p>
<p>&#8216;There may arise various occasions,&#8217; said the true Mr.
Clark, &#8216;on which the injunctions of man may interfere with
the injunctions of God; and in every such case a Christian
man must yield obedience to the authority of the highest
Lord.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 22.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Sad case that of Strathbogie!&#8217; ejaculated the conjurer.</p>
<p>&#8216;Very sad,&#8217; replied the true Mr. Clark. &#8216;What is your
version of it?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Listen,&#8217; said the conjurer. &#8216;What has been termed the
Veto Law was enacted less than ten years ago, and after
lengthened legal proceedings, was declared illegal by the
House of Lords, the highest judicial authority in this kingdom.
For proceedings adopted in conformity to this decision,
seven ministers in the Presbytery of Strathbogie were
first suspended and then deposed from their ministerial
offices, without any other charges laid against them than
that they sought the protection of the civil courts in acting
according to their decision. For refusing to obey a law
which the House of Lords declared to be illegal, no minister
can be lawfully deposed from his office in this country,
unless we are prepared to adopt a principle which would
ultimately subvert the entire authority of the law. The
civil courts, simply on the ground that these ministers had
been deposed for obeying the statutes of the realm, reversed
the sentence, as what was beyond the lawful powers of any
Church in this land, whether Voluntary or Established.
And on the same principle, they interfered to prevent any
from treating them as suspended or deposed.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue
1st</i>, p. 10.</p>
<p>&#8216;A most injurious representation of the case,&#8217; said the
true Mr. Clark. &#8216;Seven ministers, forming the majority of
the Presbytery of Strathbogie, chose to intimate their resolution
to take steps towards the settlement of Mr. Edwards
as minister of Marnoch, in defiance of the opposition of
almost all the parishioners, and in direct contempt of the
instructions given them by the superior church courts.
The civil courts in the meantime merely declared their
opinion of the law, but they issued no injunction whatever,
so as to give the presbytery the pretext of choosing between
obeying the one or the other jurisdiction; and they violated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
the express injunction of the supreme church court, without
being able to plead in justification that they had been
compelled by the civil authority to do so. They chose to
act ultroneously in violation of their duty to the Church.
They had solemnly promised to obey the superior church
courts, and had never come under any promise to obey in
spiritual things any other authority. In proposing to take
the usual steps for conferring the spiritual office of a pastor
in the Church of Christ, in defiance of the injunction laid
upon them by the supreme court of the Church of Scotland,
they plainly violated their ordination engagements. And in
actually ordaining Mr. Edwards, the whole procedure was a
solemn mockery of holy things.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 26.</p>
<p>&#8216;After all,&#8217; said the conjurer, with a sigh, &#8216;the agitated
question is but of inferior moment.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 3.</p>
<p>&#8216;Inferior moment!&#8217; exclaimed the true Mr. Clark; &#8216;no
religious question of the same magnitude and importance
has come before this country since the ever-memorable Revolution
in 1688. The divisions of secular partisanship sink
into utter insignificance when compared with this. Let the
principles once become triumphant for which the Court of
Session is now contending, and the Church of Scotland is
ruined.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, pp. 7 and 59.</p>
<p>&#8216;Ruined!&#8217; shouted out the conjurer; &#8216;it is you who are
ruining the Church, by urging on the disruption. For my
own part, I promised, as all ministers do at their ordination,
never, directly or indirectly, to endeavour her subversion,
or to follow divisive courses, but to maintain her unity and
peace against error and schism, whatsoever trouble or persecution
might arise; and now, in agreement with my solemn
ordination engagements, have I determined to hold by her
to the last.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 9.</p>
<p>&#8216;What mean you by the <i>Church</i>?&#8217; asked the true Mr.
Clark. &#8216;The Church and the establishment of it are surely
very different things. Men have talked of themselves as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
friends of the Church, because they were the friends of its
civil establishment, and loudly declaim against the proceedings
of the majority of its office-bearers now, as fraught
with danger to this object. But what do they mean by the
civil establishment of an Erastian Church! Is it possible
that they mean by it the receiving of certain pecuniary
endowments as a price for rendering a divided allegiance to
the Son of God? If that be their meaning, it is time they
and the country at large should know that the Church of
Scotland was never established on such principles.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>,
p. 42.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is not true, however,&#8217; said the conjurer, &#8216;that the
majority of the faithful ministers of Scotland have resolved
to abandon the Establishment, though this may be the case
in some parts of the country.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 16.</p>
<p>&#8216;Not true, sir!&#8217; said the true Mr. Clark; &#8216;nothing can be
more true. All&ndash;&ndash;all will leave it except a set of recreant
priests, who for a pitiful morsel of this world&#8217;s bread will
submit to be the instruments of trampling on the blood-bought
rights of the Scottish people.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 42.</p>
<p>&#8216;What has pained me most in all this controversy,&#8217; remarked
the conjurer, &#8216;has been the insidious manner in
which certain persons have endeavoured to sow disunion&ndash;&ndash;in
some cases too successfully&ndash;&ndash;between ministers and
their hearers.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 3.</p>
<p>&#8216;Sir,&#8217; exclaimed the true Mr. Clark, &#8216;Sir, every individual
would do well to remember, when summoned to such a
contest as this, the curse denounced against Meroz for
remaining in neutrality when the battle raged in Israel.
This curse was denounced by the angel of the Lord, and
is written for the admonition of all ages, as a demonstration
of the feelings with which God regards the standing aloof,
in a great religious struggle, by whatever motives it may be
sought to be justified.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>, p. 59.</p>
<p>&#8216;The men who thus sow disunion,&#8217; said the conjurer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
&#8216;never venture to deny that they, whose usefulness they
endeavour to destroy, are ministers of the gospel,&ndash;&ndash;urging
on the acceptance of a slumbering world the message of
celestial mercy, which must produce results of weal or woe
destined to be eternally remembered, when the strifes of
words which have agitated the Church on earth are all
forgotten.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 4.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hold, hold, sir,&#8217; said the true Mr. Clark. &#8216;On the
event of this struggle depends not merely the temporal
interests of our country, but the welfare of many immortal
spirits through the ceaseless ages of future being.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Sermon</i>,
p. 60.</p>
<p>&#8216;It is so distracting a subject this Church question,&#8217; said
the conjurer, &#8216;that I make it a point of duty never to bring
it to the pulpit.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue 1st</i>, p. 3.</p>
<p>&#8216;In that you and I differ,&#8217; said the true Mr. Clark, &#8216;just
as we do in other matters. I have written very long sermons
on the subject, ay, and published them too; and in particular
beg leave to recommend to your careful perusal my
sermon on the <i>Present Position</i>, preached in Inverness on
the evening of the 19th January 1840.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I suppose you have heard it said, that I changed my
views from the fear of worldly loss,&#8217; said the conjurer.&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue
1st</i>, p. 4.</p>
<p>&#8216;Heard it said!&#8217; said the true Mr. Clark. &#8216;You forget
that I have been bottled up on the hill-side yonder for the
last three years.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Sir,&#8217; said the conjurer, with great solemnity, &#8216;when the
West Church was built, in order to secure this valuable
addition to the church accommodation of the parish, I did
not hesitate to undertake, on my own personal risk, to
guarantee the payment of three thousand pounds. This
obliged me to diminish, to no small extent, my personal
expenditure, as the only way in which the pecuniary burden
could be met, without diminishing my contributions to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
the public charities of the town, and to the numerous cases
of private distress brought continually under my notice, in
the various walks of ministerial duty. And though the
original debt is now reduced to half that amount by the
liberal benefactions received from various individuals, still
nearly three-fourths of my stipend this year has been expended
on this object, in terms of my voluntary obligation.
The large sum which I am now in advance, I believe, will be
eventually repaid; but for this I have no security beyond
my confidence in the goodness of the cause, and the continued
liberality of my countrymen. All this respecting the
West Church is known to few, and would not have been
mentioned by me at this time, had it not been for the perseverance
with which some, inaccessible to higher motives
themselves, have endeavoured to persuade my hearers that
mercenary considerations have produced the position I
have felt it my duty to take in the present discussion.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Dialogue
1st</i>, p. 5.</p>
<p>For a few seconds the true Mr. Clark seemed as if struck
dumb by the intelligence. &#8216;Ah! fast anchored!&#8217; he at
length ejaculated. &#8216;Fairly tethered to the Establishment
by a stake of fifteen hundred pounds. Demas, happy man,
had a silver mine to draw him aside&ndash;&ndash;a positive silver
mine. The West Church is merely a negative one. Were
it to get into the hands of the Moderates, it would become
waterlogged to a certainty, and not a single ounce of the
precious metal would ever be fished out of it; whereas you
think there is still some little chance of recovery when you
remain to ply the pump yourself. Most disinterested man!&ndash;&ndash;let
your statement of the case be but fairly printed, and
it will serve you not only as an apology, but as an advertisement
to boot.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Printed!&#8217; said the conjurer; &#8216;I have already printed it
in English, and Mr. M&#8217;Donald the schoolmaster is translating
it into Gaelic.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span></p>
<p>But we have far exceeded our limits, and have yet given
scarce a tithe of the controversy. We found ourselves
sitting all alone in front of our own quiet fire long ere it
was half completed; and we recommend such of our
readers as are desirous to see the rest of it in the originals,
to possess themselves of the Rev. Mr. Clark&#8217;s <i>Sermon</i>, and
the Rev. Mr. Clark&#8217;s <i>Dialogues</i>. They form, when bound
up together, one of the extremest, and at the same time
one of the most tangible, specimens of inconsistency and
self-contradiction that controversy has yet exhibited; and
enable us to anticipate the character and standing of the
evangelic minority in the Erastian Church. &#8216;If the salt has
lost its savour, wherewithal shall it be salted?&#8217;</p>

<h2>PULPIT DUTIES NOT SECONDARY.</h2>
</div>
<p>There are two antagonist perils to which all evangelical
Churches, whether established or unendowed, are exposed
in an age in which men&#8217;s minds are so stirred by the fluctuations
of opinion, that though there may not be much progress,
there is at least much motion. They lie open, on
the one hand, to the danger of getting afloat on the tide of
innovation, and so drifting from the fixed position in which
Churches, as exponents of the mind of Christ, possess an
authoritative voice, into the giddy vortices of some revolving
eddy of speculation, in which they can at best assume
but the character of mere advocates of untried experiment;
or, on the other hand, they are liable to fall into the opposite
mistake of obstinately resisting all change&ndash;&ndash;however excellent
in itself, and however much a consequence of the
onward march of the species&ndash;&ndash;and this not from any direct
regard to those divine laws, of which one jot or tittle
cannot pass away, but simply out of respect to certain
peculiar views and opinions entertained by their ancestors
in ages considerably less wise than the times which have
succeeded them.</p>
<p>An evangelistic Church cannot fall into the one error
without losing its influential voice <i>as</i> a Church. It may
gain present popularity by throwing itself upon what chances
to be the onward movement of the time; but it is a spendthrift
popularity, that never fails in the end to leave it exhausted
and weak. The political ague has always its cold
as certainly as its hot fever fits: action produces reaction;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
great exertion induces great fatigue; the desired object, even
when fully gained, is sure always, like all mere sublunary
objects of pursuit, to disappoint expectation; and the Church
that, forgetting where its real power lies, seeks, Ant&aelig;us-like,
to gather strength in this way from the earth, contracts in
every instance but the soil and weakness inherent in those
earthy and unspiritual things to which it attaches itself. It,
too, comes to have its cold ague fits and its reaction&ndash;&ndash;periods
of exhaustion, disappointment, and decline. And the opposite
error of clinging to the worn-out and the obsolete
produces ultimately the same effect, though it operates in a
different way. A Church that, in behalf of some antiquated
type of thought or action, opposes itself to what is in reality
the onward current of the age, is sure always to fare like
stranded ice-floes, that, in a river flooded by thaw, retain the
exact temperature under which they were formed, when the
temperature all around them has altered. The ice-floes
and the obsolete Church may be alike successful for a time
in keeping up the ancient state of things within their own
lessening limits, but both are eventually absorbed and disappear.
While the more versatile ecclesiastical body, tossed
by the cross currents and eddies of novel and uncertain
change, loses its true course and makes shipwreck, the
rigidly immoveable one, anchored over the worn-out peculiarities
of bygone days, is borne down by the irresistible
rush of the stream, and founders at its moorings.</p>
<p>The Free Church, as a body, is, we trust, not greatly in
danger from either extreme. They are the extremes, however,
which in the present day constitute her true Scylla
and Charybdis; and it were perhaps well that she should
keep the fact steadily before her, by laying them down as
such on their chart. Not from the gross and earthy fires
of political movement in the present day, or from the cold
grey ashes of movement semi-political in some uninspired
age of the past, must that pillar of flame now ascend which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
is to marshal her on her pilgrimage through the wilderness,
at once reviving her by its heat and guiding her by its
effulgence. The light borrowed from the one would but
flicker idly before her, a wandering and delusive meteor;
the other would furnish her with but an unlighted torch,
unsuited to cast across her way a single beam of direction
and guidance. Her light must be derived from an antiquity
more remote than that of the uninspired ages, and her heat
from a source more permanent than that of present excitement,
social or political: the one direct from the unerring
record of those times when God walked the earth in the flesh;
the other from that living spirit without whose influence
energy the most untiring can be influential in but the production
of evil, and earnestness the most intense may be
profession, but cannot be revival. Strength must be sought
by her, not in the turmoil of evanescent agitation, nor in the
worn-out modes of an age the fashion of which has perished,
but in the perennial verities of the everlasting gospel. While
so far adapting herself to the times as to present an armed
front to every form of error, she must preach to her people
as if the prisoner of Patmos had but just completed the
record of Revelation.</p>
<p>There is one special error regarding this the most important
portion of her proper work&ndash;&ndash;the preaching of the
word&ndash;&ndash;to which it may be well to advert. It has become
much the fashion of the time&ndash;&ndash;most unthinkingly, surely&ndash;&ndash;to
speak of preaching as not the paramount, but merely one
of the subsidiary duties of a clergyman. &#8216;He is not a man
of much pulpit preparation,&#8217; it has become customary to
remark of some minister, at least liked if not admired, &#8216;but
he is diligent in visiting and in looking after his schools;
and preaching is in reality but a small part of a minister&#8217;s
duty.&#8217; Or, in the event of a vacancy, the flock looking out
for a pastor are apt enough to say, &#8216;Our last minister was
an accomplished pulpit man, but what we at present want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
is a man sedulous in visiting; for preaching is in reality but
a small part of a minister&#8217;s duty.&#8217; Nay, ministers, especially
ministers of but a few twelvemonths&#8217; standing, have themselves
in some cases caught up the remark, as if it embodied
a self-evident truth; and while they dare tell, not without
self-complacency, that their discourses&ndash;&ndash;things written at a
short sitting, if written at all&ndash;&ndash;cost them but little trouble,
they add further, as if by way of apology, that they are, however,
&#8216;much occupied otherwise, and that preaching is in
reality but a small part of a minister&#8217;s duty.&#8217; We have some
times felt inclined to assure these latter personages in reply,
that they might a little improve the matter just by making
preaching no part of their duty at all. But where, we ask,
is it taught, either by God in His word or by the Church in
her standards, that preaching is merely one of the minor
duties of the minister, or indeed other than his first and
greatest duty? Not, certainly, in the New Testament, for
there it has invariably the paramount place assigned to it;
as certainly not in our standards, for in them the emphasis
is &#8216;<i>especially</i>&#8217; laid on the &#8216;preaching of the word&#8217; as God&#8217;s
most &#8216;effectual means&#8217; of converting sinners. If it be a
truth that preaching is but comparatively a minor part of a
minister&#8217;s duty, it is certainly neither a Scripture nor a
Shorter Catechism truth; and, lest it should be not only
not a truth at all, but even not an innocuous <i>untruth</i>, we
think all who hold it would do well to inquire how they
have come by it.</p>
<p>We have our own suspicion regarding its origin. It is
natural for men to exaggerate the importance of whatever
good they patronize, or whatever improvement or enterprise
they advocate or recommend. And perhaps some degree
of exaggeration is indispensable. In order to create the
impulse necessary to overcome the <i>vis inerti&aelig;</i> of society, and
induce in the particular case the required amount of exertion,
the stream of the moving power has&ndash;&ndash;if we may so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
speak&ndash;&ndash;to be elevated to the level of hopes raised high
above the point of possible accomplishment. To employ
the language of the mechanist, the necessary <i>fall</i> would be
otherwise awanting, and the machine would fail to move.
If, for instance, all men had estimated the advantages of
free trade according to the sober computations of Chalmers,
the country would have no Anti-Corn-Law League, and no
repeal of the obnoxious statutes. And yet who can now
doubt that the calculations of Chalmers were in reality the
true ones? In like manner, if it had been truly seen that the
&#8216;baths for the working classes&#8217; could have merely extended
to the humbler inhabitants of our cities those advantages
of ablution which the working men of our sea-coasts already
possess, but of which&ndash;&ndash;when turned of forty&ndash;&ndash;not one out of
a hundred among them ever avails himself, we would scarce
have witnessed bath meetings, with Dukes in the chair; nor
would the baths themselves have been erected. But the
natural exaggerative feeling prevailed. Baths for the working
classes were destined somehow to renovate society, it
was thought; and so, though Chartism be now as little content
as ever, baths for the working classes our cities possess.
And, doubtless, exaggeration of a similar kind has tended
to heighten the general estimate of the minor duties of the
clergyman; and were there no invidious comparisons instituted
between the lesser and the paramount duties,&ndash;&ndash;between
what is secondary in its nature magnified into primary importance,
and what is primary in its nature diminished into
a mere secondary, and standing as if the one had been
viewed by the lesser, and the other through the greater lens
of a telescope,&ndash;&ndash;we would have no quarrel whatever with
the absolute exaggeration in the case, regarded simply as a
mere moving force. But we must quarrel with it when we
see it leading to practical error; and so, in direct opposition
to the common remark, that preaching is but a small
part of the minister&#8217;s duty, we assert that it is not a small,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
but a very large, and by far the most important part of it;
and that it is not our standards or the Scriptures that are
in error on this special head, but the numerous class who,
taking up the antagonist view, maintain as a self-evident
proposition what has neither standing in the New Testament,
nor yet guarantee in the experience of the Church.</p>
<p>No apology whatever ought to be sustained for imperfect
pulpit preparation; nay, practically at least, no apology
whatever has or will be sustained for it. It is no unusual
thing to see a church preached empty; there have been cases
of single clergymen, great in their way, who have emptied four
in succession: for people neither ought nor will misspend
their Sabbaths in dozing under sermons to which no effort
of attention, however honestly made, enables them to listen;
and what happens to single congregations may well happen
to a whole ecclesiastical body, should its general style of
preaching fall below the existing average. And certainly
we know nothing more likely to produce such a result than
the false and dangerous opinion, that preaching is comparatively
a small part of a minister&#8217;s duty. It is supereminently
dangerous for one to form a mean estimate of one&#8217;s work,
unless it be work of a nature very low and menial indeed.
&#8216;No one,&#8217; said Johnson, &#8216;ever did anything well to which
he did not give the whole bent of his mind.&#8217; It is this
low estimate&ndash;&ndash;this want of a high standard in the mind&ndash;&ndash;that
leads some of our young men to boast of the facility
with which they compose their sermons,&ndash;&ndash;a boast alike
derogatory to the literary taste and knowledge and to the
Christian character of him who makes it. Easy to compose
a sermon!&ndash;&ndash;easy to compose what, when written, cannot be
read; and what, when preached, cannot be listened to. We
believe it; for in cases of this kind the ease is all on the part
of the author. We believe further, we would fain say to the
boaster, that you and such as you could scuttle and sink
the Free Church with amazingly little trouble to yourselves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
But is it easy, think you, to mature such thoughts as Butler
matured? And yet these were embodied in sermons. Is it
easy, think you, to convey in language exquisite as that of
Robert Hall, sentiments as refined and imagery as classic
as his? And yet Hall&#8217;s noblest compositions were sermons.
Is it easy, think you, to produce a philosophic poem, the
most sublime and expansive of any age or country? And
yet such is the true character of the Astronomical Sermons
of Chalmers. Or is that spirituality which impresses and
sinks into the heart of a people, independently at times of
thought of large calibre or the polish of a fine literary taste,
a thing easily incorporated into the tissue of a lengthened
sermon? Think you, did Maclaurin&#8217;s well-known <i>Sermon
on the Cross</i> cost him little trouble? or the not less noble
sermon of Sir Matthew Hale, on <i>Christ and Him crucified</i>?
Look, we beseech you, to your New Testaments, and see
if there be ought slovenly in the style, or loose and pointless
in the thinking, of the model sermons given you there.
The discourse addressed by our Saviour from the mount to
the people was a sermon; as was also the magnificent address
of Paul to the Athenians, where he chose as his text
the inscription on one of their altars, &#8216;To the unknown
God.&#8217; There may be a practical and most mischievous
heterodoxy embodied in the preacher&#8217;s idea of sermons, as
certainly as he may embody a heterodoxy theoretic and
doctrinal in the sermons themselves.</p>
<p>The ordinary course of establishing a Church in any
country, as specially shown by New Testament history and
that of the Reformation, is first and mainly through the
preaching of the word. An earnest, eloquent man&ndash;&ndash;a Peter
in Jerusalem&ndash;&ndash;a Paul at Athens, on Mars Hill&ndash;&ndash;a John
Knox in Edinburgh or St. Andrews&ndash;&ndash;a George Whitfield
in some open field or market-place of Britain or America&ndash;&ndash;or
a Thomas Chalmers in some metropolitan pulpit, Scotch
or English&ndash;&ndash;addresses himself to the people.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span></p>
<p>There is a strange power in the words, and they cannot
but listen; and then the words begin to tell. The heart is
affected, the judgment convinced, the will influenced and
directed: ancient beliefs are, as the case may be, modified,
resuscitated, or destroyed; new or revived convictions take
the place of previous convictions, inadequate or erroneous;
and thus churches are planted, and the face of society
changed. We limit ourselves here to what&ndash;&ndash;being strictly
natural in the process&ndash;&ndash;would operate, if skilfully applied,
as directly on the side of error as of truth. It is the first
essential of a book, that it be interesting enough to be read;
and of a preacher, whatever his creed, that he be sufficiently
engaging to be attentively listened to; and without this
preliminary merit, no other merit, however great, is of any
avail whatever. And when a Church possesses it in any
great degree, it is sure to spread and increase. Are there
churches in the Establishment which, though thinned by the
Disruption, have now all their seats let, and are crammed
every Sabbath to the doors? If so, be sure there is popular
talent in the pulpit, and that the clergyman who officiates
there does not find it a very easy matter to compose his
sermons. Nay, dear as the distinctive principles of the Free
Church are to the people of Scotland, with superior pulpit
talent in the Establishment on the one hand, and in the
ranks of the disendowed body, on the other, a goodly supply
of those youthful ministers who boast that they either never
write their sermons, or write them at a short sitting, we
would by no means guarantee to our Church a ten years&#8217;
vigorous existence. These may not be palatable truths,
but we trust they are wholesome ones; and we know that
the time peculiarly requires them. It is, however, not
mainly with the Establishment that the Free Church has to
contend.</p>
<p>We ask the reader whether he has not marked, within the
last few years, the <i>d&eacute;but</i> of another and more formidable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
antagonist, with which all Christian Churches may be soon
called on to grapple?</p>
<p>Our newly-instituted athen&aelig;ums and philosophical associations
form one of the novel features of the time,&ndash;&ndash;institutions
in which at least the second-class men of the age&ndash;&ndash;Emersons,
and Morells, and Combes&ndash;&ndash;with much that is
interesting in science and fascinating in literature, blend
sentiments and opinions at direct variance with the great
doctrinal truths embodied in our standards. The press, not
less formidable now than ever, is an old antagonist; but,
with all its appliances and powers, it lacked the charm of
the living voice. That peculiar charm, however, the new
combatant possesses. The pulpit, met by its own weapons
and in its own field, will have to a certainty to measure its
strength against it; and the standard of pulpit accomplishment
and of theological education, instead of being lowered,
must in consequence be greatly elevated. The Church of
this country, which in the earlier periods of her history,
when Knox was her leader, and Buchanan the moderator of
her General Assembly, stood far in advance of the age in
popular eloquence, solid learning, and elegant accomplishment,
and which, in the person of Chalmers in our own
days, was vested in the more advanced views and the more
profound policy of a full century hence, must not be suffered
to lag behind the age now. Her troops must not be
permitted to fall into confusion, and to use as arms the rude,
unsightly bludgeons of an untaught and undisciplined mob,
when the enemy, glittering in harness, and furnished with
weapons keen of temper and sharp of edge, is bearing down
upon them in compact phalanx.</p>
<p>We know what it is to have sat for many years under
ministers who, possessed of great popular talent and high
powers of original thought, gave much time and labour to
pulpit preparation. We know how great a privilege it is to
have to look forward to the ministrations of the Sabbath,&ndash;&ndash;not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
as wearinesses, which, simply as a matter of duty, were
to be endured; but as exquisite feasts, spiritual and intellectual,
which were to be greatly relished and enjoyed.
And when hearing it sometimes regretted, with reference to
at least one remarkable man, that he did not visit his flock
quite so often as was desirable&ndash;&ndash;many of the complainants&#8217;
sole idea of a ministerial visit, meanwhile, being simply
that it was a long exordium of agreeable gossip, with a
short tail-piece of prayer stuck to its hinder end&ndash;&ndash;we have
strongly felt how immensely better it was that the assembled
congregation should enjoy each year fifty-two Sabbaths of
their minister at his best, than that the tone of his pulpit
services should be lowered, in order that each individual
among them might enjoy a yearly half-hour of him apart.
And yet such, very nearly, was the true statement of the
case. We fully recognise the importance, in its own subordinate
place, of ministerial visitation, especially when
conducted&ndash;&ndash;a circumstance, however, which sometimes
lowers its popularity&ndash;&ndash;as it ought to be. But it must not
be assigned that prominent place denied to it by our standards,
and which the word of God utterly fails to sanction.</p>
<p>It is, though an important, still a minor duty; and the
Free Church must not be sacrificed to the ungrounded idea
that it occupies a level as high, or even nearly as high, as
&#8216;the preaching of the word.&#8217; To that peculiar scheme of
visitation advocated by Chalmers as a first process in his
work of excavation, we of course do not refer. In those
special cases to which he so vigorously directed himself,
visitation was an inevitable preliminary, without which the
appliances of the pulpit could not be brought to bear. Philip
had to open the Scriptures <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> to the Ethiopian eunuch,
for the Ethiopian eunuch never came to church.</p>
<p>But even were his scheme identical with that to which
we particularly refer, we would say to the young preacher
who sheltered under his authority, &#8216;Well, prepare for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
pulpit as Dr. Chalmers did, even when he had the West
Port congregation for his audience, and we shall be quite
content to let you visit as much as you may.&#8217; The composition
of a sermon was never easy work to him. He
devoted to it much time, and the full bent of his powerful
mind; and even when letting himself down to the humblest
of the people, the philosopher of largest capacity might
profitably take his place among the hearers, and listen with
an interest never for one moment suffered to flag.</p>

<h2>DUGALD STEWART.</h2>
</div>
<p>It is now more than forty years since it was remarked
by Jeffrey, in his <i>Review</i>, that metaphysical science was
decidedly on the decline in Scotland. Dugald Stewart,
though in a delicate state of health at the time, was in the
full vigour of his faculties, and had still eighteen years of
life before him; Thomas Brown had just been appointed
his assistant and successor in the Moral Philosophy Chair
of the University of Edinburgh; and the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the Scottish
capital were flocking in crowds to his class-room, captivated
by the eloquence and ingenuity of his singularly vigorous
and original lectures. Even fifteen years subsequent, Dr.
Welsh could state, in the Life of his friend, that the reception
of his work on the <i>Philosophy of the Human Mind</i> had
been &#8216;favourable to a degree of which, in metaphysical
writings, there was no parallel.&#8217; It has been recorded as a
very remarkable circumstance, that the <i>Essay</i> of Locke&ndash;&ndash;produced
at a period when the mind of Europe first awoke
to general activity in the metaphysical province&ndash;&ndash;passed
through seven editions in the comparatively brief space of
fourteen years. The <i>Lectures</i> of Dr. Brown passed through
exactly seven editions in <i>twelve</i> years, and this at a time
when, according to Jeffrey, that science of mind of which
they treated was in a state of gradual decay. The critic
was, however, in the right. The genius of Brown had imparted
to his brilliant posthumous work an interest which
could scarce be regarded as attaching to the subject of it;
and in a few years after&ndash;&ndash;from about the year 1835 till
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
after the disruption of the Scottish Church&ndash;&ndash;metaphysical
science had sunk, not in Scotland only, but all over Britain,
to its lowest ebb. A few retired scholars continued to
prosecute their researches in the province of mind; but
scarce any interest attached to their writings, and not a
bookseller could be found hardy enough to publish at his
own risk a metaphysical work. We are old enough to
remember a time, contemporaneous with the latter days of
Brown, when young students, in their course of preparation
for the learned professions, especially for the Church, used
to be ever recurring in conversation to the staple metaphysical
questions,&ndash;&ndash;occasionally, no doubt, much in the
style of Jack Lizard in the <i>Guardian</i>, who comforted his
mother, when the worthy lady was so unlucky as to scald
her hand with the boiling tea-kettle, by assuring her there
was no such thing as heat, but which at least served to
show that this branch of liberal education fully occupied
the mind of the individuals ostensibly engaged in mastering
it; and we remember a subsequent time, when students&ndash;&ndash;some
of them very clever ones&ndash;&ndash;seemed never to have
thought on these questions at all, and remained silent in
conversation when they chanced to be mooted by the men
of an earlier generation. During, however, the last ten
years, mainly through the revival of a taste for metaphysical
inquiry in France and Germany, which has reacted on this
country, abstract questions on the nature and functions of
mind are again acquiring their modicum of space and importance
in Scotland. Our country no longer takes the
place it once did among the nations in this department,
and never again may; but it at least begins to remember it
once was, and to serve itself heir to the works of the older
masters of mind; and we regard it as an evidence of the
reaction to which we refer, that a greatly more complete
edition of the writings of Dugald Stewart than has yet appeared
is at the present time in the course of issuing from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
the press of one of our most respected Scotch publishers&ndash;&ndash;the
inheritor of a name paramount in the annals of the
trade&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Thomas Constable.</p>
<p>The writings of Dugald Stewart have been unfortunate in
more than that state of exhaustion and syncope into which
metaphysical science continued to sink during the lapse of
more than half a generation after the death of their author,
and the commencement of which had been remarked by
Jeffrey more than half a generation before. From some
peculiar views&ndash;&ndash;founded, we believe, on an overweening
estimate of their pecuniary value&ndash;&ndash;the son and heir of the
philosopher tabooed their publication; and it is only now
that, in consequence of his death, and of the juster views
entertained on the subject by a sister, also recently deceased,
that they are permitted to reappear. The time,
however, from that awakened interest in metaphysical
speculation which we have remarked, seems highly favourable
for such an undertaking; and we cannot doubt that the
work will find what it deserves&ndash;&ndash;a sure and steady, if not
very rapid sale. Stewart may be regarded as not merely
one of the more distinguished members of the Scottish
school of metaphysics, but as peculiarly its historian and
exponent. The mind of Reid was cast in a more original
mould, but he wanted both the elegance and the eloquence
of Stewart, nor were his powers of illustration equally great.
His language, too, was not only less refined and flowing,
but also less scientifically correct, than that of his distinguished
exponent and successor. We would cite, for
instance, the happy substitution by the latter of the terms
&#8216;laws of human thought and belief,&#8217; for the unfortunate
phrases &#8216;common sense&#8217; and &#8216;instinct,&#8217; which raised so
extensive a prejudice against the vigorous protest against
scepticism made in other respects so effectively by Reid;
and he passes oftener from the abstractions of his science
into the regions of life and character in which all must feel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
interested, however slight their acquaintance with the
subtleties of metaphysical speculation. The extraordinary
excellence of Professor Stewart&#8217;s style has been recognised
by the highest authorities. Robertson was perhaps the best
English writer of his day. The courtly Walpole, on ascertaining
that he spoke Scotch, told him he was heartily glad
of it; for &#8216;it would be too mortifying,&#8217; he added, &#8216;for Englishmen
to find that he not only wrote, but also spoke, their
language better than themselves.&#8217; And yet the Edinburgh
Reviewers recognised Stewart as the writer of a more
exquisite style than even Robertson. And Sir James
Mackintosh, no mean judge, characterizes him as the
most perfect, in an artistic point of view, of the philosophical
writers of Britain. &#8216;Probably no writer ever exceeded
him,&#8217; says Sir James, &#8216;in that species of eloquence
which springs from sensibility to literary merit and moral
excellence; which neither obscures science by prodigal
ornament, nor disturbs the serenity of patient attention;
but, though it rather calms and soothes the feelings, yet
exalts the genius, and insensibly inspires a reasonable
enthusiasm for whatever is good and fair.&#8217; Now, it is
surely not unimportant that the writings of such a man,
simply in their character as literary models, should be submitted
to an age like the present, especially to its Scotchmen.
It is stated by Hume, in one of his letters to
Robertson, that meeting in Paris with the lady who first
gave to the French a translation of Charles V., he asked
her what she thought of the style of the work, and that
she instantly replied, with great <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, &#8216;Oh, it is such a
style as only a Scotchman could have written.&#8217; Scotland
did certainly stand high in the age of Hume and Mackenzie,
of Robertson and of Adam Smith, for not only the vigour
of its thinking, but also for the purity and excellence of
its style. We fear, however, it can no longer arrogate to
itself praise on this special score. There have been books
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
produced among us during the last twenty years, which
have failed in making their way into England, mainly in
consequence of the slipshod style in which they were
written. A busy age, much agitated by controversy, is
no doubt unfavourable to the production of compositions
of classic beauty. &#8216;The rounded period,&#8217; says an ingenious
French writer, &#8216;opens up the long folds of its floating robe
in a time of stability, authority, and confidence. But when
literature has become a means of action, instead of continuing
to be used for its own sake, we no longer amuse
ourselves with the turning of periods. The period is contemporary
with the peruke&ndash;&ndash;the period is the peruke of
style. The close of the eighteenth century shortened the
one as much as the other. The peruke reaching the middle
of the loins could not be suitable to men in haste to accomplish
a work of destruction. When was J. J. Rousseau
himself given to the turning of periods? Assuredly it was
not in his pamphlets!&#8217; Now the style of Stewart was first
formed, we need scarce remark, during that period of profound
repose which preceded the French Revolution; and
his after-life, spent in quiet and thoughtful retirement, with
the classics of our own and other countries, ancient and
modern, for his companions, and with composition as his
sole employment&ndash;&ndash;though the world around him was fiercely
engaged with politics or with war&ndash;&ndash;had nothing in it to
deteriorate it. He never heard the steam-press groaning,
as the night wore late, for his unfinished lucubrations; nay,
we question if he ever wrote a careless or hurried sentence.
His naturally faultless taste had full space to satisfy itself
with whatever he deemed it necessary to perform; and
hence works of finished beauty, which, as pieces of art, the
younger <i>literati</i> of Scotland would do well to study and
imitate. There may be differences of opinion regarding
the standing of Stewart as a metaphysician, but there are
no differences of opinion regarding his excellence as a writer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span></p>
<p>With regard to metaphysics themselves, we are disposed
to acquiesce in the judgment of Jeffrey, without, however,
acquiescing in much which he has founded upon it. To
<i>observe</i> as a mental philosopher, and to <i>experiment</i> as a
natural one, are very different things; and never will mere
observation in the one field lead to results so splendid or
so practical as experiment on the properties of matter, to
which man owes his extraordinary control over the elements.
To the knowledge acquired by his observations on
the nature or operations of mind, he owes no new power
over that which he surveys: in at least its direct consequences,
his science is barren. It would be difficult, however,
to overestimate its <i>indirect</i> consequences. It seems
impossible that the metaphysical province should long exist
blank and unoccupied in any highly civilised country, especially
in a country of active and acquiring intellects, such
as Scotland. If the philosophy of Locke or of Reid fail
to occupy the field, we find it occupied instead by that
of Comte or of Combe. Owens and Martineaus take the
place of Browns and of Stewarts; and bad metaphysics, of
the most dangerous tendency, are taught, in the lack of
metaphysics wholesome and good. All the more dangerous
parties of the present day have their foundations of principle
on a basis of bad metaphysics. The same remark
applies to well-nigh all the religious heresies; and the less
metaphysical an age is, all the more superficial usually are
the heresies which spring up in it. We question whether
Morrisonianism could have originated in what was emphatically
the metaphysical age of Scotland, in the latter
days of Reid, or the earlier days of Stewart. What became
in our times a heresy in the theological field, would have
spent itself, as the mere crotchet of a few unripened intellects,
in the metaphysical one. It would have found
vent in some debating club or speculative society, and the
Churches would have rested in peace. There are other indirect
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
benefits derived from metaphysical study. It forms
the best possible gymnastics of mind. All the great metaphysicians,
if not merely acute, but also broad-minded men,
have been great also in the practical departments of thought.
The author of the <i>Essay on the Human Understanding</i> was
the author also of the <i>Treatise on Government</i> and the <i>Letters
on Toleration</i>. Hume, in those <i>Essays on Trade and Politics</i>,
which are free from the stain of infidelity, was one of the
most solid of thinkers; and he who produced the <i>Theory
of Moral Sentiments</i> continues to give law at the present
time, in his <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, to the commerce of the
civilised world. From a subtile but comparatively narrow
class of intellects, though distinguished in the metaphysical
province, mankind has received much less. Berkeley was
one of these, and may be regarded as their type and representative.
Save his metaphysics,&ndash;&ndash;demonstrative of the
non-existence of matter, or demonstrative rather that fire
is not conscious of heat, nor ice of cold, nor yet our enlightened
surface of colour,&ndash;&ndash;he bequeathed little else to
the world than his tar-water; and his tar-water, no longer
recognised as a universal medicine, has had its day, and is
forgotten. Without professing to know aught of German
metaphysicians&ndash;&ndash;for in the times when we used to read
Hume and Reid they were but little known in this country&ndash;&ndash;we
can by no means rate them so high as the men whose
writings they are supplanting. What, we have been accustomed
to ask, are their trophies in the practical? Have
any of them given to the world even tar-water? Where are
their Lockes, Humes, and Adam Smiths? The man who,
according to Johnson, can walk vigorously towards the
east, can walk vigorously toward the west also. How is
it that these German metaphysicians exhibit their vigour
exclusively in walking one way? Where are their works
of a practical character, powerful enough to give law to the
species? Where their treatises like those of Locke on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
<i>Toleration</i> or on <i>Government</i>, or their essays like that of
Hume or of Adam Smith on the <i>Balance of Power</i> or the
<i>Wealth of Nations</i>? Are they doing other, to use a very
old illustration, than merely milking rams, leaving their
admirers and followers to hold the pail?</p>
<p>Dugald Stewart, though mayhap less an original in the
domain of abstract thought than some of his predecessors,
belongs emphatically to the practical school. With him
philosophy is simply common sense on that large scale which
renders it one of the least common things in the world.
And never, perhaps, was there a more thoroughly honest
seeker after truth. Burns somewhat whimsically describes
him, in a recently recovered letter given to the world by
Robert Chambers, as &#8216;that plain, honest, worthy man, the
Professor. I think,&#8217; adds the poet, &#8216;his character, divided
into ten parts, stands thus: Four parts Socrates, four parts
Nathaniel, and two parts Shakespeare&#8217;s Brutus.&#8217; The estimate
of Sir James Mackintosh is equally high; nor will it
weigh less with many of our readers that the elder M&#8217;Crie
used to give expression to a judgment quite as favourable.
&#8216;He was fascinated,&#8217; says the son and biographer of the
latter, &#8216;with the <i>beau ideal</i> of academical eloquence which
adorned the Moral Chair in the person of Dugald Stewart.
Long after he had sat under this admired leader, he would
describe with rapture his early emotions while looking on
the handsomely erect and elastic figure of the Professor&ndash;&ndash;in
every attitude a model for the statuary&ndash;&ndash;listening to expositions,
whether of facts or principles, always clear as the
transparent stream; and charmed by the tones of a voice
which modulated into spoken music every expression of intelligence
and feeling. An esteemed friend of his happening
to say to him some years ago, &#8220;I have been hearing Dr.
Brown lecture with all the eloquence of Dugald Stewart,&#8221;
&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; he exclaimed with an air of almost Johnsonian
decision, &#8220;you have not, and no man ever will.&#8217;&#8221; The first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
volume of the collected works of Stewart, now given to the
world in a form at once worthy of their author and of the
name of Constable, contains the far-famed <i>Dissertations</i>, and
is edited by Sir William Hamilton. It contains a considerable
amount of original matter, now published from the
author&#8217;s manuscripts for the first time. It would be idle
to attempt criticising a work so well established; but the
brief remark of one of the first of metaphysical critics&ndash;&ndash;Sir
James Mackintosh&ndash;&ndash;on what he well terms &#8216;the magnificent
Dissertations,&#8217; may be found not unacceptable. &#8216;These Dissertations,&#8217;
says Sir James, &#8216;are perhaps most profusely
ornamented of any of their author&#8217;s compositions,&ndash;&ndash;a peculiarity
which must in part have arisen from a principle of
taste, which regarded decoration as more suitable to the
history of philosophy than to philosophy itself. But the
memorable instances of Cicero, of Milton, and still more
those of Dryden and Burke, seem to show that there is
some natural tendency in the fire of genius to burn more
brightly, or to blaze more fiercely, in the evening than in
the morning of human life. Probably the materials which
long experience supplies to the imagination, the boldness
with which a more established reputation arms the mind,
and the silence of the low but formidable rivals of the
higher principles, may concur in providing this unexpected
and little observed effect.&#8217;</p>

<h2>OUR TOWN COUNCILS.</h2>
</div>
<p>It is a grand, though doubtless natural, mistake to hold that
the members of the Town Councils of our Scottish cities
and burghs really represent in opinion and feeling their
nominal constituencies the electors, through whose suffrages
they have been placed in office. In very many cases they
do not represent them at all: they form an entirely dissimilar
class,&ndash;&ndash;a class as thoroughly different from the solid
mass of the community, on which they float like froth
and spume on the surface of the great deep, as that other
class from which, because there are unhappily scarce any
other men in the field, we have to select our legislators.
The subject is one of importance. In the Sabbath controversy
now carrying on, it has been invariably taken for
granted by the anti-Sabbatarian press of the country, that
our Town Councils <i>do</i> represent the general constituency;
and there has been much founded on the assumption. We
shall by and by be finding the same assumption employed
against us in the Popery endowment question; and it
would be well, therefore, carefully to examine the grounds
on which it rests, and to ascertain whether there may not
exist some practical mode of testing its unsolidity.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see how that upper class to which
our legislators of both Houses of Parliament mainly belong,
should differ greatly from the larger and more solid portion
of the middle classes in almost all questions of a religious
character and bearing. Bacon, in his <i>Essay on Kings</i>, has
quaintly, but, we are afraid, all too justly remarked, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
&#8216;of all kind of men, God is the least beholding unto them
[kings]; for He doth most for them, and they do ordinarily
least for Him.&#8217; But the character applies to more than
kings. It affects the whole upper layers of the great
pyramid of society, from its gilded pinnacle down to the
higher confines of its solid middle portion; and to these
upper layers of the erection our legislators, hereditary and
elective, with, of course, a very few exceptions in the Lower
House, all belong. They are drafted from the classes with
which, if we perhaps except the lowest and most degraded
of all, religious questions weigh least. There is, of course,
no class wholly divorced from good; and those exceptions
to which Cowper could refer two generations ago obtain
still:</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8216;</span>We boast some rich ones whom the gospel sways,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>And one who wears a coronet, and prays:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Like gleanings of an olive tree, they show</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>Here and there one upon the topmost bough.&#8217;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>But in at least the mass, religion has not been influential
among the governing classes in Britain since the days of
the Commonwealth. It has formed one of the great forces
on which they have calculated&ndash;&ndash;a formidable power among
the people, that they have striven, according to the nature
of the emergency, to quiet or awaken, bias or control,&ndash;&ndash;now
for the ends of party, when an antagonist faction had to be
overborne and put down,&ndash;&ndash;now for the general benefit of
the country, when a foreign enemy had to be repelled or an
intestine discord to be suppressed; but it has been peculiarly
a force outside the governing classes&ndash;&ndash;external, not
internal, to them,&ndash;&ndash;a power which it has been their special
work to regulate and direct, not a power which has regulated
and directed them. The last British Government which&ndash;&ndash;God,
according to Bacon, having done much for it&ndash;&ndash;laboured
earnestly to do much for God, was that very remarkable
one which centred in the person of the Lord Protector.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span></p>
<p>Hence naturally much that is unsatisfactory to the comparatively
religious middle classes of the country, in the
conduct, with regard to religious questions, of the classes
on whom devolves the work of legislation. There is no
real community of feeling and belief in these matters
between the two. To the extent to which religion is involved
in the legislative enactments of the time, the middle
class is in reality not represented, and the upper class does
not represent. It may not seem equally obvious, however,
how there should be a lack of representation, not only
among our members of Parliament, but also among our
members of Council. They at least surely belong, it may
be said, to the middle classes, by whom and from among
whom they are chosen for their office. Certainly in some
cases they do; in many others, however, they form a class
scarce less peculiar than those upper classes out of which
the legislators of the country come to be drawn, simply
because there is no other class in the field out of which
they can be selected.</p>
<p>The Reform and Municipality Bills wrought a mighty
change in the Town Councils of the kingdom. The old close
burgh system, with all its abuses, ceased for ever, save in its
remains&ndash;&ndash;monumental debts, and everlasting leases of town
lands, granted on easy terms to officials and their friends; and
droll recollections, like those embalmed by Galt in our literature,
of solid municipal feasting, and not so solid municipal
services,&ndash;&ndash;of exclusive cliqueships, misemployed patronages,
modest self-elections,&ndash;&ndash;in short, of a general practice of jobbing,
more palpable than pleasant, and that tended rather to
individual advantage than corporate honour. The old men
retired, and a set of new men were elevated by newly-created
constituencies into their vacated places, to be disinterested
on dilapidated means, and noisy on short commons. The
days of long and heavy feasts had come to a close, and the
days of long and heavy speeches succeeded. No two events
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span>
which this world of ours ever saw, led to so vast an amount
of bad speaking as the one Reform Bill that swept away
the rotten burghs, and the other Reform Bill that opened
the close ones. By and by, however, it came to be seen
that the old, privileged, self-elected class were succeeded in
many instances by a class that, though elected by their
neighbours, were yet not quite like their neighbours. Their
neighbours were men who, with their own personal business
to attend to, had neither the time nor the ambition to be
moving motions or speaking speeches in the eye of the
public, and who could not take the trouble to secure elections
by canvassing voters. The men who had the time,
and took the trouble, were generally a class ill-hafted in
society, who had high notions of reforming everything save
themselves, and of keeping right all kinds of businesses
except their own. The old state of things was, notwithstanding
its many faults, a state under which our Scotch
burghers rose into consideration by arts of comparative
solidity. A tradesman or shopkeeper looked well to his
business,&ndash;&ndash;became an important man in the market-place
and a good man in the bank,&ndash;&ndash;increased in weight in the
same proportion that his coffers did so, and grew influential
and oracular on the strength of his pounds sterling per
annum. With altered times, however, there arose a new
order of men,&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; '>&#8216;The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was no longer necessary to spend the greater part of a
lifetime in acquiring money and character: a glib tongue,
a few high professions of public principle, and a few weeks&#8217;
canvassing, were found to serve the turn more than equally
well.</p>
<p>There commenced straightway a new dynasty of dignities
and honours. Councillors got into print in the capacity of
speechmakers, who, save for the revolution effected, would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
never have got into print in any other capacity than, mayhap,
that of bankrupts in the Gazette. Eloquent men
walked to church in scarlet, greatly distinguished as provosts
and bailies, who but for the happy change would have crept
unseen all their lives long among the crowd. Members of
Parliament went arm-in-arm, when they visited their constituencies,
with folk altogether unused to such consideration;
and when a burgher&#8217;s son sought to be promoted to
the excise, or a seaman to the coast-guard service, it was
through the new men that influence had to be exerted.
And of course the new men had to approve themselves
worthy of their honours, by making large sacrifices for the
public weal. They had in many cases not much to do: the
magistracy of the bygone school, whom they succeeded,
had obligingly relieved posterity of the trouble of having a
too preponderous amount of municipal property to manage
and look after; but if they had not much to do, they had
at least a great deal to say; and as they were ambitious of
saying it, their own individual concerns were not unfrequently
neglected, in order that their constituencies might
be edified and informed. In cases not a few, the natural
consequences ensued. We have in our eye one special
burgh in the north, in which every name in the Town
Council, from that of the provost down to that of the
humblest councillor, had, in the course of some two or
three years, appeared also in the <i>Gazette</i>; and the previous
provost of the place had got desperately involved with the
branch banks of the district, and had ultimately run the
country, to avoid a prosecution for forgery.</p>
<p>Let it not be held that we are including the entire tribe
of modern town functionaries in one sweeping condemnatory
description. We ourselves, in our time (we refer to
the fact with a high but surely natural pride), held office as
a town councillor, under the modern <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, for the space
of three whole years in a parliamentary burgh that contained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
no fewer than forty voters. All may learn from history how
it was that Bailie Weezle earned his municipal honours
during the ancient state of things in the famous burgh of
Gudetown. &#8216;Bailie Weezle,&#8217; says Galt, &#8216;was a man not
overladen with worldly wisdom, and had been chosen into
the Council principally on account of being easily managed.
Being an idle person living on his money, and of a soft and
quiet nature, he was, for the reason aforesaid, taken by one
consent among us, where he always voted on the provost&#8217;s
side; for in controverted questions every one is beholden
to take a part, and the bailie thought it was his duty to side
with the chief magistrate.&#8217; Our own special qualifications
for office were, we must be permitted in justice to ourselves
to state, different from Bailie Weezle&#8217;s by a shade.</p>
<p>It was generally held, that if there was nothing to do we
would <i>do</i> nothing, and if nothing to say we would <i>say</i>
nothing; and so thoroughly did we fulfil every expectation
that had been previously formed of us, that for three years
together we said and did nothing in our official capacity
with great <i>&eacute;clat</i>, and regularly absented ourselves from every
meeting of Council except the first, to the entire satisfaction
of our constituency. It will not be held, therefore, in the
face of so important a fact, that we include in our description
all the town magistracies under the existing state of things,
and most certainly not all modern town councillors.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, can be more certain, we repeat, than
that they differ from their constituencies as a class, and that
they are chosen to represent them in municipal affairs, just
as another and higher class is chosen to represent them in
the Legislature&ndash;&ndash;merely because there is no other class in the
field. The solid middle-class men of business have, as has
been said, something else to employ them, and cannot spare
their services. They cannot accept of mere notoriety, with
mayhap a modicum of patronate influence attached, as an
adequate price for the time and labour which their own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
affairs demand. It is a peculiar class in the municipal as
in the literary field, that &#8216;weigh solid pudding against empty
praise,&#8217; and come to regard the empty praise as solid enough
to outweigh the pudding. Not but that it is a fine thing to
be in a Town Council, and to see one&#8217;s fortnightly speeches
flourishing in the public prints. Where else could some of
our Edinburgh worthies bring themselves so prominently
before the eyes of the country?</p>
<p>Where else, for instance, could Councillor &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; impart
such universal interest to the fact that he taught in a Sabbath
school, and rode out of town every evening to attend to its
duties by a Sunday train,&ndash;&ndash;thus forming an invariable item,
it would seem, in the average of the ninety-two Sabbath
journeyers that travelled by the Edinburgh and Glasgow
Railway, and failed to remunerate the proprietors? Or
where else could Councillor &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; refer with such prodigious
effect to Dr. Chalmers&#8217;s bloody-minded scheme of
&#8216;<i>executing</i> the heathen?&#8217; Or where else could Councillor
&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; succeed in eliciting so general a belief that he was one
of the poor endangered heathens over which the threatened
<i>execution</i> hung, through his famous oath &#8216;By Jupiter?&#8217;</p>
<p>By the way, is this latter gentleman acquainted with
Smollett&#8217;s story of the eccentric Mr. H., and chivalrously
bent, on the same principle, in acknowledging a deity in
distress? &#8216;Mr. H., some years ago, being in the Campidoglio
at Rome,&#8217; says Smollett, &#8216;made up to the bust of
Jupiter, and bowing very low, exclaimed, in the Italian
language, &#8220;I hope, sir, if ever you get your head above
water again, you will remember that I paid my respects to
you in your adversity.&#8221; This sally,&#8217; continues the historian,
&#8216;was reported to the Cardinal Camerlengo, and by him laid
before the Pope Benedict <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>XIV.</span>, who could not help laughing
at the extravagance of the address, and said to the
Cardinal, &#8220;Those English heretics think they have a right
to go to the devil in their own way.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span></p>
<p>Now, standing, as we do, either on the threshold of
serious national controversies of a religious bearing, or
already entered upon them, it would be well to mark and
test the facts which it is our present object specially to
point out. It would be well to take measures for rendering
it an as palpable as it is a solid truth, that the municipal
<i>tail</i> of the country&#8217;s representation no more really represents
it in several very important respects than its parliamentary
<i>head</i>. It represents it most inadequately on the Sabbath
question now; it will represent it quite as inadequately in
the Popish endowment question by and by; and if in reality
we do not wish to see the battle going against us on both
issues, there must be effective means employed to demonstrate
the fact. In matters of a religious bearing, the ill-hafted
notoriety-men of our Town Councils much more
nearly resemble the upper indifferent classes, from which
our legislators are drafted, than they do the solid bulk of
the community.</p>
<p>They are decidedly in the movement party, and form a
portion, not of the ballast, but of the superfluous sail, of
the State. Nor should it be difficult to render the fact
evident to all. In one of our northern burghs&ndash;&ndash;Dingwall&ndash;&ndash;a
majority of the Town Council lately memorialized the
Directors of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in exactly
the same vein as the majority of our Edinburgh Town
Council. So extreme a step seemed rather extraordinary
for Ross-shire; and a gentleman of the burgh, one of the
voters, convinced that the officials were far indeed from
representing their constituency, shrewdly set himself to
demonstrate the real state of the case. First he possessed
himself of an accredited list of the voters; and then, with a
memorial addressed to the Directors, strongly condemnatory
of the conduct of the Council, he called upon every
voter in the burgh who had not taken the opposite side in
the character of a councillor, with the exception of two,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span>
whose views he had previously ascertained to be unfavourable.
And what, thinks our reader, was the result? Seven
councillors had voted on the anti-Sabbatarian side; and the
provost, for himself and the Council, had afterwards signed
the memorial. And of the voters outside, four were found
to make common cause with them. Two more did not
make common cause with them, but were not prepared to
condemn them, and so did not sign. There were thus
fourteen in all who were either not opposed to the running
of Sabbath trains, or who were at least not disposed openly
to denounce the parties who had memorialized the Directors,
in the name of the burgh, to the effect that Sabbath
trains should be run. Of the other electors, ten were non-resident,
five more were out of town at the time, three had
fallen out of possession since the roll had been made up,
and one was dead. And all the others, amounting to sixty-nine
in number, at once signed the document condemnatory
of the Council, and were happy to have an opportunity of
doing so. The available votes of the burgh were opposed
to those of their pseudo-representatives in the proportion
of nearly six to one.</p>
<p>In the parliamentary burgh of Cromarty an almost similar
experiment was made. There, however, though the movement
party had composed the majority of the Council only
a few years since, they had been cast out of office, partly
through a strong reaction which had taken place against
them, partly in consequence of a quarrel among themselves.
And so the existing Town Council took the initiative in
memorializing the Directors in favour of the recent resolution
not to run Sunday trains. Of all the voters of the
burgh, only five stood aloof; all the others made common
cause with the Town Council in attaching their names to
their document.</p>
<p>But it is a significant fact, that in the knot of five the
ex-councillors of the movement party were included; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
that had <i>they</i> been in the Council still, a majority would to
a certainty have voted in the wake of the Edinburgh Town
Council. There is much instruction in facts such as these;
and they may be turned to great practical account.</p>
<p>Why should not the sentiments of every voter in Scotland
be taken on this same Sabbath question now? or what
is there to prevent us from taking the sentiments of every
voter in Scotland on the Popish endowment question by
and by?</p>
<p>It is a tedious and expensive matter to get up petitions,
to which all and sundry affix their names; but the franchise-holders
of Scotland are comparatively a not very numerous
class; and about the same amount of labour that goes to
a monthly collection for the Sustentation Fund, would be
quite sufficient to place before Government and the country
the full expression of <i>their</i> feelings and opinions on the two
leading questions of the day. But enough for the present&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;a
word to the wise.&#8217;</p>

<h3>OR,<br />HOW A COUNTRY MAY BE RUINED.</h3>
</div>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<p>There appeared at Paris, about five years ago, a singularly
ingenious work on political economy, from the pen of the
late M. de Sismondi, a writer of European reputation. The
greater part of the first volume is taken up with discussions
on territorial wealth, and the condition of the cultivators of
the soil; and in this portion of the work there is a prominent
place assigned to a subject which perhaps few Scotch
readers would expect to see introduced through the medium
of a foreign tongue to the people of a great continental
State. We find this philosophic writer, whose works are
known far beyond the limits of his language, devoting an
entire essay to the case of the late Duchess of Sutherland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
and her tenants, and forming a judgment on it very unlike
the decision of political economists in our own country,
who have not hesitated to characterize her great and singularly
harsh experiment, whose worst effects we are but
beginning to see, as at once justifiable in itself and happy
in its results. It is curious to observe how deeds done as
if in darkness and a corner, are beginning, after the lapse
of nearly thirty years, to be proclaimed on the house-tops.
The experiment of the late Duchess was not intended to be
made in the eye of Europe. Its details would ill bear the
exposure. When Cobbett simply referred to it only ten
years ago, the noble proprietrix was startled, as if a rather
delicate family secret was on the eve of being divulged;
and yet nothing seems more evident now than that civilised
man all over the world is to be made aware of how the
experiment was accomplished, and what it is ultimately to
produce. It must be obvious, further, that the infatuation
of the present proprietor, in virtually setting aside the
Toleration Act on his property, must have the effect of
spreading the knowledge of it all the more widely, and of
rendering its results much more disastrous than they could
have possibly been of themselves.</p>
<p>In a time of quiet and good order, when law, whether in
the right or the wrong, is all-potent in enforcing its findings,
the argument which the philosophic Frenchman employs in
behalf of the ejected tenantry of Sutherland, is an argument
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
at which proprietors may afford to smile. In a time of
revolution, however, when lands change their owners, and
old families give place to new ones, it might be found
somewhat formidable,&ndash;&ndash;sufficiently so, at least, to lead a
wise proprietor in an unsettled age rather to conciliate
than oppress and irritate the class who would be able in
such circumstances to urge it with most effect. It is not
easy doing justice in a few sentences to the facts and
reasonings of an elaborate essay; but the line of the argument
runs somewhat thus.</p>
<p>Under the old Celtic tenures&ndash;&ndash;the only tenures, be it
remembered, through which the lords of Sutherland derive
their rights to their lands&ndash;&ndash;the <i>Klaan</i>, or children of the
soil, were the proprietors of the soil: &#8216;the whole of Sutherland,&#8217;
says Sismondi, belonged to &#8216;the men of Sutherland.&#8217;
Their chief was their monarch, and a very absolute monarch
he was. &#8216;He gave the different <i>tacks</i> of land to his officers,
or took them away from them, according as they showed
themselves more or less useful in war. But though he
could thus, in a military sense, reward or punish the clan,
he could not diminish in the least the property of the clan
itself;&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;he was a chief, not a proprietor, and had &#8216;no
more right to expel from their homes the inhabitants of his
county, than a king to expel from his country the inhabitants
of his kingdom.&#8217; &#8216;Now, the Gaelic tenant,&#8217; continues
the Frenchman, &#8216;has never been conquered; nor did he
forfeit, on any after occasion, the rights which he originally
possessed;&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;in point of right, he is still a co-proprietor
with his captain. To a Scotchman acquainted with the law
of property as it has existed among us, in even the Highlands,
for the last century, and everywhere else for at least
two centuries more, the view may seem extreme; not so,
however, to a native of the Continent, in many parts of
which prescription and custom are found ranged, not on
the side of the chief, but on that of the vassal. &#8216;Switzerland,&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
says Sismondi, &#8216;which in so many respects resembles
Scotland&ndash;&ndash;in its lakes&ndash;&ndash;its mountains&ndash;&ndash;its climate&ndash;&ndash;and the
character, manners, and habits of its children&ndash;&ndash;was likewise
at the same period parcelled out among a small number of
lords. If the Counts of Kyburgh, of Lentzburg, of Hapsburg,
and of Gruyeres, had been protected by the English
laws, they would find themselves at the present day precisely
in the condition in which the Earls of Sutherland
were twenty years ago. Some of them would perhaps have
had the same taste for <i>improvements</i>, and several republics
would have been expelled from the Alps, to make room for
flocks of sheep.&#8217; &#8216;But while the law has given to the Swiss
peasant a guarantee of perpetuity, it is to the Scottish laird
that it has extended this guarantee in the British empire,
leaving the peasant in a precarious situation.&#8217; &#8216;The clan&ndash;&ndash;recognised
at first by the captain, whom they followed in
war and obeyed for their common advantage, as his friends
and relations, then as his soldiers, then as his vassals, then
as his farmers&ndash;&ndash;he has come finally to regard as hired
labourers, whom he may perchance allow to remain on the
soil of their common country for his own advantage, but
whom he has the power to expel so soon as he no longer
finds it for his interest to keep them.&#8217;</p>
<p>Arguments like those of Sismondi, however much their
force may be felt on the Continent, could be formidable at
home, as we have said, in only a time of revolution, when
the very foundations of society would be unfixed, and
opinion set loose, to pull down or reconstruct at pleasure.
But it is surely not uninteresting to mark how, in the course
of events, that very law of England which, in the view
of the Frenchman, has done the Highland peasant so
much less, and the Highland chief so much more than
justice, is bidding fair, in the case of Sutherland at least, to
carry its rude equalizing remedy along with it. Between the
years 1811 and 1820, fifteen thousand inhabitants of this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
northern district were ejected from their snug inland farms,
by means for which we would in vain seek a precedent,
except, perchance, in the history of the Irish massacre.
But though the interior of the county was thus <i>improved</i>
into a desert, in which there are many thousands of sheep,
but few human habitations, let it not be supposed by the
reader that its general population, was in any degree lessened.
So far was this from being the case, that the census of 1821
showed an increase over the census of 1811 of more than
two hundred; and the present population of Sutherland
exceeds, by a thousand, its population before the change.
The county has not been depopulated&ndash;&ndash;its population has
been merely arranged after a new fashion. The late
Duchess found it spread equally over the interior and the
sea-coast, and in very comfortable circumstances;&ndash;&ndash;she left
it compressed into a wretched selvage of poverty and suffering,
that fringes the county on its eastern and western
shores. And the law which enabled her to make such an
arrangement, maugre the ancient rights of the poor Highlander,
is now on the eve of stepping in, in its own clumsy
way, to make her family pay the penalty. The evil of a
poor-law can be no longer averted from Scotland. However
much we may dislike compulsory assessment for the
support of our poor, it can be no longer avoided. Our
aristocracy have been working hard for it during the whole
of the present century, and a little longer; the disruption
of the Scottish Church, as the last in a series of events, all
of which have tended towards it, has rendered it inevitable.
Let the evidence of the present commissioners on the subject
be what it may, it cannot be of a kind suited to show
that if England should have a poor-law, Scotland should
have none. The southern kingdom must and will give us
a poor-law; and then shall the selvage of deep poverty
which fringes the sea-coasts of Sutherland avenge on the
titled proprietor of the county both his mother&#8217;s error and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
his own. If our British laws, unlike those of Switzerland,
failed miserably in <i>her</i> day in protecting the vassal, they
will more than fail, in those of her successor, in protecting
the lord. Our political economists shall have an opportunity
of reducing their arguments regarding the improvements
in Sutherland into a few arithmetical terms, which
the merest tyro will be able to grapple with.</p>
<p>We find a similar case thus strongly stated by Cobbett in
his <i>Northern Tour</i>, and in connection with a well-known
name:&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;Sir James Graham has his estate lying off this
road to the left. He has not been <i>clearing</i> his estate&ndash;&ndash;the
poor-law would not let him do that; but he has been clearing
off the small farms, and making them into large ones,
which he had a right to do, because it is he himself that is
finally to endure the consequences of that: he has a right
to do that; and those who are made indigent in consequence
of his so doing, have a right to demand a maintenance
out of the land, according to the Act of the 43d of
Elizabeth, which gave the people a <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>COMPENSATION</span> for the
loss of the tithes and church lands which had been taken
away by the aristocracy in the reigns of the Tudors. If Sir
James Graham choose to mould his fine and large estate
into immense farms, and to break up numerous happy
families in the middle rank of life, and to expose them all
to the necessity of coming and demanding sustenance from
his estate; if he choose to be surrounded by masses of
persons in this state, he shall not call them <i>paupers</i>, for
that insolent term is not to be found in the compensation-laws
of Elizabeth; if he choose to be surrounded by swarms
of beings of this description, with feelings in their bosoms
towards him such as I need not describe,&ndash;&ndash;if he choose this,
his RIGHT certainly extends thus far; but I tell him that he
has no right to say to any man born in his parishes, &#8220;You
shall not be here, and you shall not have a maintenance off
these lands.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span></p>
<p>There is but poor comfort, however, to know, when one
sees a country ruined, that the perpetrators of the mischief
have not ruined it to their own advantage. We purpose
showing how signal in the case of Sutherland this ruin has
been, and how very extreme the infatuation which continues
to possess its hereditary lord. We are old enough to remember
the county in its original state, when it was at once
the happiest and one of the most exemplary districts in
Scotland, and passed, at two several periods, a considerable
time among its hills; we are not unacquainted with it now,
nor with its melancholy and dejected people, that wear out
life in their comfortless cottages on the sea-shore. The
problem solved in this remote district of the kingdom is not
at all unworthy the attention which it seems but beginning
to draw, but which is already not restricted to one kingdom,
or even one continent.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span></div>
<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER II.</h3>
<p>We heard sermon in the open air with a poor Highland
congregation in Sutherlandshire only a few weeks ago; and
the scene was one which we shall not soon forget. The
place of meeting was a green hill-side, near the opening
of a deep, long withdrawing strath, with a river running
through the midst. We stood on the slope where the last
of a line of bold eminences, that form the southern side of
the valley, sinks towards the sea. A tall precipitous mountain,
reverend and hoary, and well fitted to tranquillize the
mind, from the sober solemnity that rests on its massy features,
rose fronting us on the north; a quiet burial-ground
lay at its feet; while, on the opposite side, between us and
the sea, there frowned an ancient stronghold of time-eaten
stone&ndash;&ndash;an impressive memorial of an age of violence and
bloodshed. The last proprietor, says tradition, had to quit
this dwelling by night, with all his family, in consequence of
some unfortunate broil, and take refuge in a small coasting
vessel; a terrible storm arose&ndash;&ndash;the vessel foundered at sea&ndash;&ndash;and
the hapless proprietor and his children were nevermore
heard of. And hence, it is said, the extinction of the race.</p>
<p>The story speaks of an unsettled time; nor is it difficult
to trace, in the long deep valley on the opposite hand,
the memorials of a story not less sad, though much more
modern. On both sides the river the eye rests on a multitude
of scattered patches of green, that seem inlaid in the
brown heath. We trace on these islands of sward the
marks of furrows, and mark here and there, through the
loneliness, the remains of a group of cottages, well-nigh
levelled with the soil, and, haply like those ruins which
eastern conquerors leave in their track, still scathed with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
fire. All is solitude within the valley, except where, at wide
intervals, the shieling of a shepherd may be seen; but at
its opening, where the hills range to the coast, the cottages
for miles together lie clustered as in a hamlet. From the
north of Helmsdale to the south of Port Gower, the lower
slopes of the hills are covered by a labyrinth of stone fences,
minute patches of corn, and endless cottages. It would
seem as if for twenty miles the long withdrawing valley had
been swept of its inhabitants, and the accumulated sweepings
left at its mouth, just as we see the sweepings of a
room sometimes left at the door. And such generally is
the present state of Sutherland. The interior is a solitude
occupied by a few sheep-farmers and their hinds; while a
more numerous population than fell to the share of the
entire county, ere the inhabitants were expelled from their
inland holdings, and left to squat upon the coast, occupy
the selvage of discontent and poverty that fringes its shores.
The congregation with which we worshipped on this occasion
was drawn mainly from these cottages, and the neighbouring
village of Helmsdale. It consisted of from six to
eight hundred Highlanders, all devoted adherents of the
Free Church. We have rarely seen a more deeply serious
assemblage; never certainly one that bore an air of such
deep dejection. The people were wonderfully clean and
decent; for it is ill with Highlanders when they neglect
their personal appearance, especially on a Sabbath; but it
was all too evident that the heavy hand of poverty rested
upon them, and that its evils were now deepened by oppression.
It might be a mere trick of association; but when
their plaintive Gaelic singing, so melancholy in its tones at
all times, arose from the bare hill-side, it sounded in our
ears like a deep wail of complaint and sorrow. Poor
people! &#8216;We were ruined and reduced to beggary before,&#8217;
they say, &#8216;and now the gospel is taken from us.&#8217;</p>
<p>Nine-tenths of the poor people of Sutherland are adherents
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
of the Free Church&ndash;&ndash;all of them in whose families
the worship of God has been set up&ndash;&ndash;all who entertain a
serious belief in the reality of religion&ndash;&ndash;all who are not the
creatures of the proprietor, and have not stifled their convictions
for a piece of bread&ndash;&ndash;are devotedly attached to the
disestablished ministers, and will endure none other. The
residuary clergy they do not recognise as clergy at all.
The Established churches have become as useless in the
district, as if, like its Druidical circles, they represented
some idolatrous belief, long exploded&ndash;&ndash;the people will not
enter them; and they respectfully petition his Grace to be
permitted to build other churches for themselves. And
fain would his Grace indulge them, he says. In accordance
with the suggestions of an innate desire, willingly would he
permit them to build their own churches and support their
own ministers. But then, has he not loyally engaged to
support the Establishment? To permit a religious and
inoffensive people to build their own places of worship, and
support their own clergy, would be sanctioning a sort of
persecution against the Establishment; and as his Grace
dislikes religious persecution, and has determined always to
oppose whatever tends to it, he has resolved to make use
of his influence, as the most extensive of Scottish proprietors,
in forcing them back to their parish churches. If
they persist in worshipping God agreeably to the dictates
of their conscience, it must be on the unsheltered hill-side&ndash;&ndash;in
winter, amid the frosts and snows of a severe northern
climate&ndash;&ndash;in the milder seasons, exposed to the scorching
sun and the drenching shower. They must not be permitted
the shelter of a roof, for that would be persecuting
the Establishment; and so to the Establishment must the
people be forced back, literally by stress of weather. His
Grace owes a debt to the national institution, and it seems
to irk his conscience until some equivalent be made. He
is not himself a member&ndash;&ndash;he exercises the same sort of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span>
liberty which his people would so fain exercise; and to
make amends for daring to belong to another Church himself
(that of England), he has determined, if he can help it,
that the people shall belong to no other. He has resolved,
it would seem, to compound for his own liberty by depriving
them of theirs.</p>
<p>How they are to stand out the winter on this exposed
eastern coast, He alone knows who never shuts His ear to
the cry of the oppressed. One thing is certain, they will
never return to the Establishment. On this Sabbath the
congregation in the parish church did not, as we afterwards
learned, exceed a score; and the <i>quoad sacra</i> chapel of the
district was locked up. Long before the Disruption the
people had well-nigh ceased attending the ministrations of
the parish incumbent. The Sutherland Highlanders are still
a devout people; they like a bald mediocre essay none the
better for its being called a sermon, and read on Sabbath.
The noble Duke, their landlord, has said not a little in his
letters to them about the extreme slightness of the difference
which obtains between the Free and the Established
Churches: it is a difference so exceedingly slight, that his
Grace fails to see it; and he hopes that by and by, when
winter shall have thickened the atmosphere with its frost
rime and its snows, his poor tenantry may prove as unable
to see it as himself. With them, however, the difference is
not mainly a doctrinal one. They believe with the old
Earls of Sutherland, who did much to foster the belief in
this northern county, that there is such a thing as personal
piety,&ndash;&ndash;that of two clergymen holding nominally the same
doctrines, and bound ostensibly by the same standards, one
may be a regenerate man, earnestly bent on the conversion
of others, and ready to lay down his worldly possessions,
and even life itself, for the cause of the gospel; while the
other may be an unregenerate man, so little desirous of the
conversion of others, that he would but decry and detest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
them did he find them converted already, and so careless
of the gospel, that did not his living depend on professing
to preach it, he would neither be an advocate for it himself,
nor yet come within earshot of where it was advocated
by others. The Highlanders of Sutherland hold in deep
seriousness a belief of this character. They believe, further,
that the ministers of their own mountain district
belong to these two classes&ndash;&ndash;that the Disruption of the
Scottish Church has thrown the classes apart&ndash;&ndash;that the
residuaries are not men of personal piety&ndash;&ndash;they have seen
no conversions attending their ministry&ndash;&ndash;nor have they
lacked reason to deem them unconverted themselves.
Unlike his Grace the Duke, the people have been intelligent
enough to see two sets of principles ranged in decided
antagonism in the Church question; but still more clearly
have they seen two sets of men. They have identified the
cause of the gospel with that of the-Free Church in their
district; and neither the Duke of Sutherland nor the
Establishment which he is &#8216;engaged in endeavouring to
maintain,&#8217; will be able to reverse the opinion.</p>
<p>We have said that his Grace&#8217;s ancestors, the old earls,
did much to foster this spirit. The history of Sutherland,
as a county, differs from all our other Highland districts.
Its two great families were those of Reay and Sutherland,
both of which, from an early period of the Reformation,
were not only Protestant, but also thoroughly evangelical.
It was the venerable Earl of Sutherland who first subscribed
the National Covenant in the Greyfriars. It was a scion of
the Reay family&ndash;&ndash;a man of great personal piety&ndash;&ndash;who led
the troops of William against Dundee at Killiecrankie.
Their influence was all-powerful in Sutherland, and directed
to the best ends; and we find it stated by Captain Henderson,
in his general view of the agriculture of the country, as
a well-established and surely not uninteresting fact, that
&#8216;the crimes of rapine, murder, and plunder, though not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span>
unusual in the county during the feuds and conflicts of the
clans, were put an end to about the year 1640&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;a full
century before our other Highland districts had become
even partially civilised. &#8216;Pious earls and barons of former
times,&#8217; says a native of the county, in a small work published
in Edinburgh about sixteen years ago, &#8216;encouraged
and patronized pious ministers, and a high tone of religious
feeling came thus to be diffused throughout the country.&#8217;
Its piety was strongly of the Presbyterian type; and in no
district of the south were the questions which received such
prominence in our late ecclesiastical controversy better
understood by both the people and the patrons, than in
Sutherland a full century ago. We have before us an interesting
document, the invitation of the elders, parishioners,
and heritors of Lairg, to the Rev. Thomas M&#8217;Kay, 1748,
to be their minister, in which, &#8216;hoping that&#8217; he would find
their &#8216;call, carried on with great sincerity, unanimity, and
order, to be a clear call from the Lord,&#8217; they faithfully
promise to &#8216;yield him, in their several stations and relations,
all dutiful respect and encouragement.&#8217; William
Earl of Sutherland was patron of the parish, but we find
him on this occasion exercising no patronate powers: at
the head of parishioners and elders he merely adhibits his
name. He merely <i>invites</i> with the others. The state of
morals in the county was remarkably exemplified at a later
period by the regiment of Sutherland Highlanders, embodied
originally in 1793, under the name of the Sutherlandshire
Fencibles, and subsequently in 1800 as the 93d
Regiment. Most other troops are drawn from among the
unsettled and reckless part of the population; not so the
Sutherland Highlanders. On the breaking out of the
revolutionary war, the mother of the present Duke summoned
them from their hills, and five hundred fighting men
marched down to Dunrobin Castle, to make a tender of
their swords to their country, at the command of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span>
chieftainess. The regiment, therefore, must be regarded
as a fair specimen of the character of the district; and from
the description of General Stewart of Garth, and one or
two sources besides, we may learn what that character was.</p>
<p>&#8216;In the words of a general officer by whom they were
once reviewed,&#8217; says General Stewart, &#8216;they exhibited a
perfect pattern of military discipline and moral rectitude.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;When stationed at the Cape of Good Hope, anxious to
enjoy the advantages of religious instruction agreeably to
the tenets of their national Church, and there being no
religious service in the garrison except the customary one
of reading prayers to the soldiers on parade, the Sutherland
men formed themselves into a congregation, appointed
elders of their own number, engaged and paid a stipend
(collected among themselves) to a clergyman of the Church
of Scotland (who had gone out with an intention of teaching
and preaching to the Caffres), and had divine service
performed agreeably to the ritual of the Established Church....
In addition to these expenses, the soldiers regularly
remitted money to their relatives in Sutherland. When they
disembarked at Plymouth in August 1814, the inhabitants
were both surprised and gratified. On such occasions it
had been no uncommon thing for soldiers to spend in
taverns and gin-shops the money they had saved. In the
present case the soldiers of Sutherland were seen in book-sellers&#8217;
shops, supplying themselves with Bibles and such
books and tracts as they required. Yet, as at the Cape,
where their religious habits were so free of all fanatical
gloom that they occasionally indulged in social meetings
and dancing, so here, while expending their money on books,
they did not neglect their personal appearance; and the
haberdashers&#8217; shops had also their share of trade, from the
purchase of additional feathers to their bonnets, and such
extra decorations as the correctness of military regulations
allow to be introduced into the uniform. Nor, while thus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
mindful of themselves&ndash;&ndash;improving their mind and their
personal appearance&ndash;&ndash;did such of them as had relations in
Sutherland forget their destitute condition, <i>occasioned by the
loss of their lands</i>, and the operation of the <i>improved state of
the country</i>. During the short period that the regiment was
quartered at Plymouth, upwards of &pound;500 were lodged in
one banking house to be remitted to Sutherland, exclusive
of many sums sent through the Post Office and by officers.
Some of the sums exceeded &pound;20 from an individual soldier.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;In the case of such men,&#8217; continues the General, &#8216;disgraceful
punishment was as unnecessary as it would have
been pernicious. Indeed, so remote was the idea of such
a measure in regard to them, that when punishments were
to be inflicted on others, and the troops in camp, garrison,
or quarters assembled to witness the execution, the presence
of the Sutherland Highlanders&ndash;&ndash;either of the fencibles
or of the line&ndash;&ndash;was dispensed with; the effect of terror,
as a check to crime, being in their case uncalled for, &#8220;<i>as
examples of that nature were not necessary for such honourable
soldiers</i>.&#8221; Such were these men in garrison. How
thoroughly they were guided by honour and loyalty in the
field, was shown at New Orleans. Although many of their
countrymen who had emigrated to America were ready
and anxious to receive them, there was not an instance
of desertion; nor did one of those who were left behind,
wounded or prisoners, forget their allegiance and remain
in that country, at the same time that desertions from the
British army were but too frequent.&#8217;</p>
<p>This is testimony which even men of the world will
scarce suspect. We can supplement it by that of the
missionary whom the Sutherlandshire soldiers made choice
of at Cape Town as their minister. We quote from a letter
by the Rev. Mr. Thom, which appeared in the <i>Christian
Herald</i> of October 1814:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8216;When the 93d Sutherland Highlanders left Cape Town
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
last month,&#8217; writes the reverend gentleman, &#8216;there were
among them 156 members of the church (including three
elders and three deacons), all of whom, so far as man can
know the heart from the life, were pious persons. The
regiment was certainly a pattern for morality and good
behaviour to every other corps. They read their Bibles;
they observed the Sabbath; they saved their money in
order to do good; 7000 rix-dollars (&pound;1400 currency) the
non-commissioned officers and privates gave for books,
societies, and the support of the gospel&ndash;&ndash;a sum perhaps
unparalleled in any other corps in the world, given in the
short space of seventeen or eighteen months. Their example
had a general good effect on both the colonists and
heathen. How they may act as to religion in other parts
is known to God; but if ever apostolic days were revived in
modern times on earth, I certainly believe some of these to
have been granted to us in Africa.&#8217;</p>
<p>One other extract of a similar kind: we quote from a
letter to the Committee of the Edinburgh Gaelic School
Society, Fourth Annual Report:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8216;The regiment (93d) arrived in England, when they
immediately received orders to proceed to North America;
but before they re-embarked, the sum collected for your
Society was made up, and has been remitted to your treasurer,
amounting to seventy-eight pounds sterling.&#8217;</p>
<p>We dwell with pleasure on this picture; and shall present
the reader, in our next chapter, with a picture of similar
character, taken from observation, of the homes in which
these soldiers were reared. The reverse is all too stern,
but we must exhibit <i>it</i> also, and show how the influence
which the old Earls of Sutherland employed so well, has been
exerted by their descendants to the ruin of their country.
But we must first give one other extract from General
Stewart. It indicates the track in which the ruin came.</p>
<p>&#8216;Men like these,&#8217; he says, referring to the Sutherland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
Highlanders, &#8216;do credit to the peasantry of the country.
If this conclusion is well founded, the removal of so many
of the people from their ancient seats, where they acquired
those habits and principles, must be considered a public
loss of no common magnitude. It must appear strange,
and somewhat inconsistent, when the same persons who
are loud in their professions of an eager desire to promote
and preserve the religious and moral virtues of the people,
should so frequently take the lead in approving of measures
which, by removing them from where they imbibed principles
which have attracted the notice of Europe, and
placed them in situations where poverty, and the too
frequent attendants, vice and crime, will lay the foundation
of a character which will be a disgrace, as that already
obtained has been an honour, to this country. In the new
stations where so many Highlanders are now placed, and
crowded in such numbers as to preserve the numerical
population, while whole districts are left without inhabitants,
how can they resume their ancient character and
principles, which, according to the reports of those employed
by the proprietors, have been so deplorably broken
down and deteriorated&ndash;&ndash;a deterioration which was entirely
unknown till the recent change in the condition of the
people, and the introduction of that system of placing
families on patches of potato ground, as in Ireland&ndash;&ndash;a
system pregnant with degradation, poverty, and disaffection,
and exhibiting daily a prominent and deplorable
example, which might have forewarned Highland proprietors,
and prevented them from reducing their people
to a similar state? It is only when parents and heads of
families in the Highlands are moral, happy, and contented,
that they can instil sound principles into their children,
who, in their intercourse with the world, may once more
become what the men of Sutherland have already been,
&#8220;an honourable example, worthy the imitation of all.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span></p>
<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER III.</h3>
<p>We have exhibited the Sutherland Highlanders to the
reader as they exhibited themselves to their country, when,
as Christian soldiers,&ndash;&ndash;men, like the old chivalrous knight,
&#8216;without fear or reproach,&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;they fought its battles and
reflected honour on its name. Interest must attach to the
manner in which men of so high a moral tone were reared;
and a sketch drawn from personal observation of the interior
of Sutherland eight-and-twenty years ago, may be found
to throw very direct light on the subject. To know what
the district once was, and what it is now, is to know with
peculiar emphasis the meaning of the sacred text, &#8216;One
sinner destroyeth much good.&#8217;</p>
<p>The eye of a Triptolemus Yellowlee would have found
exceedingly little to gratify it in the parish of Lairg thirty
years ago. The parish had its bare hills, its wide, dark
moors, its old doddered woods of birch and hazel, its extensive
lake, its headlong river, and its roaring cataract.
Nature had imparted to it much of a wild and savage
beauty; but art had done nothing for it. To reverse the
well-known antithesis in which Goldsmith sums up his
description of Italy,&ndash;&ndash;the only growth that had <i>not</i> dwindled
in it was man. The cottage in which we resided with an
aged relative and his two stalwart sons, might be regarded
as an average specimen of the human dwellings of the district.
It was a low long building of turf, consisting of four
apartments on the ground floor,&ndash;&ndash;the one stuck on to the
end of the other, and threaded together by a passage that
connected the whole. From the nearest hill the cottage
reminded one of a huge black snail crawling up the slope.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span>
The largest of the four apartments was occupied by the
master&#8217;s six milk cows; the next in size was the ha&#8217;, or
sitting-room,&ndash;&ndash;a rude but not uncomfortable apartment,
with the fire on a large flat stone in the middle of the floor.
The apartment adjoining was decently partitioned into
sleeping places; while the fourth and last in the range&ndash;&ndash;more
neatly fitted up than any of the others, with furniture
the workmanship of a bred carpenter, a small bookcase
containing from forty to fifty volumes, and a box-bed of
deal&ndash;&ndash;was known as the stranger&#8217;s room. There was a
straggling group of buildings outside, in the same humble
style,&ndash;&ndash;a stable, a barn, a hay-barn, a sheep-pen with a
shed attached, and a milk-house; and stretching around the
whole lay the farm,&ndash;&ndash;a straggling patch of corn land of from
twelve to fifteen acres in extent, that, from its extremely
irregular outline, and the eccentric forms of the parti-coloured
divisions into which it was parcelled, reminded
one of a coloured map. Encircling all was a wide sea of
heath studded with huge stones&ndash;&ndash;the pasturage land of
the farmer for his sheep and cattle&ndash;&ndash;which swept away on
every hand to other islands of corn and other groups of
cottages, identical in appearance with the corn land and
the cottages described.</p>
<p>We remember that, coming from a seaport town, where,
to give to property the average security, the usual means
had to be resorted to, we were first struck by finding that
the door of our relative&#8217;s cottage, in this inland parish, was
furnished with neither lock nor bar. Like that of the
hermit in the ballad, it opened with a latch; but, unlike
that of the hermit, it was not because there were no stores
under the humble roof to demand the care of the master.
It was because that, at this comparatively recent period,
the crime of theft was unknown in the district. The philosophic
Biot, when occupied in measuring the time of the
seconds pendulum, resided for several months in one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_407' name='page_407'></a>407</span>
smaller Shetland islands; and, fresh from the troubles of
France,&ndash;&ndash;his imagination bearing about, if we may so speak,
the stains of the guillotine,&ndash;&ndash;the state of trustful security in
which he found the simple inhabitants filled him with astonishment.
&#8216;Here,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;during the twenty-five
years in which Europe has been devouring herself, the door
of the house I inhabit has remained open day and night.&#8217;
The whole interior of Sutherland was, at the time of which
we write, in a similar condition. It did not surprise us
that the old man, a person of deep piety, regularly assembled
his household night and morning for the purpose of family
worship, and led in their devotions: we had seen many
such instances in the low country. But it did somewhat
surprise us to find the practice universal in the parish. In
every family had the worship of God been set up. One
could not pass an inhabited cottage in the evening, from
which the voice of psalms was not to be heard. On Sabbath
morning, the whole population might be seen wending
their way, attired in their best, along the blind half-green
paths in the heath, to the parish church. The minister was
greatly beloved, and all attended his ministrations. We still
remember the intense joy which his visits used to impart to
the household of our relative. This worthy clergyman still
lives, though the infirmities of a stage of life very advanced
have gathered round him; and at the late disruption,
choosing his side, and little heeding, when duty called, that
his strength had been wasted in the labour of forty years,
and that he could now do little more than testify and suffer
in behalf of his principles, he resigned his hold of the temporalities
as minister of Dornoch, and cast in his lot with
his brethren of the Free Church. And his venerable successor
in Lairg, a man equally beloved and exemplary, and
now on the verge of his eightieth year, has acted a similar
part. Had such sacrifices been made in such circumstances
for other than the cause of Christ&ndash;&ndash;had they been made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
under some such romantic delusion as misled of old the
followers of the Stuarts&ndash;&ndash;the world would have appreciated
them highly; but there is an element in evangelism which
repels admiration, unless it be an admiration grounded in
faith and love; and the appeal in such cases must lie,
therefore, not to the justice of the world, but to the judgment-seat
of God. We may remind the reader, in passing,
that it was the venerable minister of Lairg who, on
quitting his manse on the Disruption, was received by
his widowed daughter into a cottage held of the Duke
of Sutherland, and that for this grave crime&ndash;&ndash;the crime of
sheltering her aged father&ndash;&ndash;the daughter was threatened
with ejection by one of the Duke&#8217;s creatures. Is it not
somewhat necessary that the breath of public opinion
should be let in on this remote country? But we digress.</p>
<p>A peculiar stillness seemed to rest over this Highland
parish on the Sabbath. The family devotions of the morning,
the journey to and from church, and the public services
there, occupied fully two-thirds of the day. But there remained
the evening, and of it the earlier part was spent in
what are known in the north country as fellowship meetings.
One of these was held regularly in the &#8216;ha&#8217;&#8217; of our relative.
From fifteen to twenty people, inclusive of the family, met
for the purposes of social prayer and religious conversation,
and the time passed profitably away, till the closing night
summoned the members of the meeting to their respective
homes and their family duties. We marked an interesting
peculiarity in the devotions of our relative. He was, as we
have said, an old man, and had worshipped in his family
long ere Dr. Stewart&#8217;s Gaelic translation of the Scriptures
had been introduced into the county; and as he was supplied
in those days with only the English Bible, while his
domestics understood only Gaelic, he had to acquire the
art, not uncommon in Sutherland at the time, of translating
the English chapter for them, as he read, into their native
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span>
tongue; and this he had learned to do with such ready
fluency, that no one could have guessed it to be other than
a Gaelic work from which he was reading. It might have
been supposed, however, that the introduction of Dr.
Stewart&#8217;s edition would have rendered this mode of translation
obsolete; but in this and many other families such
was not the case. The old man&#8217;s Gaelic was <i>Sutherlandshire
Gaelic</i>. His family understood it better, in consequence,
than any other; and so he continued to translate
from his English Bible, <i>ad aperturam libri</i>, many years after
the Gaelic edition had been spread over the county. The
fact that such a practice should have been common in
Sutherland, says something surely for the intelligence of
the family patriarchs of the district. That thousands of
the people who knew the Scriptures through no other
medium, should have been intimately acquainted with the
saving doctrines and witnesses of their power (and there
can be no question that such was the case), is proof enough,
at least, that it was a practice carried on with a due perception
of the scope and meaning of the sacred volume.
One is too apt to associate intelligence with the external
improvements of a country&ndash;&ndash;with well-enclosed fields and
whitewashed cottages; but the association is altogether a
false one. As shown by the testimony of General Stewart
of Garth, the Sutherland regiment was not only the most
eminently moral, but, as their tastes and habits demonstrated,
one of the most decidedly intellectual under the
British Crown. Our relative&#8217;s cottage had, as we have
said, its bookcase, and both his sons were very intelligent
men; but intelligence derived directly from books was not
general in the county; a very considerable portion of the
people understood no other language than Gaelic, and
many of them could not even read; for at this period about
one-tenth of the families of Sutherland were distant five or
more miles from the nearest school. Their characteristic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span>
intelligence was of a kind otherwise derived: it was an
intelligence drawn from these domestic readings of the
Scriptures and from the pulpit; and is referred mainly to
that profound science which even a Newton could recognise
as more important and wonderful than any of the
others, but which many of the shallower intellects of our
own times deem no science at all. It was an intelligence
out of which their morality sprung; it was an intelligence
founded in earnest belief.</p>
<p>But what, asks the reader, was the economic condition&ndash;&ndash;the
condition with regard to circumstances and means of
living&ndash;&ndash;of these Sutherland Highlanders? How did they
fare? The question has been variously answered: much
must depend on the class selected from among them as
specimens of the whole,&ndash;&ndash;much, too, taking for granted the
honesty of the party who replies, on his own condition in
life, and his acquaintance with the circumstances of the
poorer people of Scotland generally. The county had its
less genial localities, in which, for a month or two in the
summer season, when the stock of grain from the previous
year was fast running out, and the crops on the ground not
yet ripened for use, the people experienced a considerable
degree of scarcity,&ndash;&ndash;such scarcity as a mechanic in the
south feels when he has been a fortnight out of employment.
But the Highlander had resources in these seasons
which the mechanic has not. He had his cattle and his
wild pot-herbs, such as the mugwort and the nettle. It has
been adduced by the advocates of the change which has
ruined Sutherland, as a proof of the extreme hardship of
the Highlander&#8217;s condition, that at such times he could
have eaten as food a broth made of nettles, mixed up with
a little oatmeal, or have had recourse to the expedient of
bleeding his cattle, and making the blood into a sort of
pudding. And it is quite true that the Sutherlandshire
Highlander was in the habit, at such times, of having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
recourse to such food. It is not less true, however, that
the statement is just as little conclusive regarding his condition,
as if it were alleged there must always be famine in
France when the people eat the hind legs of frogs, or in
Italy when they make dishes of snails. We never saw
scarcity in the house of our relative, but we have seen the
nettle broth in it very frequently, and the blood-pudding
oftener than once; for both dishes were especial favourites
with the Highlanders. With regard to the general comfort
of the people in their old condition, there are better tests
than can be drawn from the kind of food they occasionally
ate. The country hears often of dearth in Sutherland now:
every year in which the crop falls a little below average in
other districts, is a year of famine there; but the country
never heard of dearth in Sutherland then. There were
very few among the holders of its small inland farms who
had not saved a little money. Their circumstances were
such, that their moral nature found full room to develope
itself, and in a way the world has rarely witnessed. Never
were there a happier or more contented people, or a people
more strongly attached to the soil; and not one of them
now lives in the altered circumstances on which they were
so rudely precipitated by the landlord, who does not look
back on this period of comfort and enjoyment with sad and
hopeless regret. We have never heard the system which
has depopulated this portion of the country defended, without
recurring to our two several visits to the turf cottage
in Lairg, or without feeling that the defence embodied an
essential falsehood, which time will not fail to render evident
to the apprehensions of all.</p>
<p>We would but fatigue our readers were we to run over half
our recollections of the interior of Sutherland. They are
not all of a serious cast. We have sat in the long autumn
evenings in the cheerful circle round the turf-fire of the ha&#8217;,
and have heard many a tradition of old clan feuds pleasingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span>
told, and many a song of the poet of the county, Old Rob
Donn, gaily sung. In our immediate neighbourhood, by
the side of a small stream&ndash;&ndash;small, but not without its
supply of brown trout, speckled with crimson&ndash;&ndash;there was a
spot of green meadow land, on which the young men of the
neighbourhood used not unfrequently to meet and try their
vigour in throwing the stone. The stone itself had its
history. It was a ball of gneiss, round as a bullet, that had
once surmounted the gable of a small Popish chapel, of
which there now remained only a shapeless heap of stones,
that scarce overtopped the long grass amid which it lay.
A few undressed flags indicated an ancient burying-ground;
and over the ruined heap, and the rude tombstones that
told no story, an ancient time-hallowed tree, coeval with
the perished building, stretched out its giant arms. Even
the sterner occupations of the farm had in their very variety
a strong smack of enjoyment. We found one of the old
man&#8217;s sons engaged, during our one visit, in building an
outhouse, after the primitive fashion of the Highlands, and
during our other visit, in constructing a plough. The two
main <i>cupples</i> of the building he made of huge trees, dug out
of a neighbouring morass; they resembled somewhat the
beams of a large sloop reversed. The stones he carried
from the outfield heath on a sledge; the interstices in the
walls he caulked with moss; the roof he covered with sods.
The entire erection was his workmanship, from foundation
to ridge. And such, in brief, was the history of all those
cottages in the interior of Sutherland, which the poor Highlanders
so naturally deemed their own, but from which,
when set on fire and burnt to the ground by the creatures
of the proprietor, they were glad to escape with their lives.
The plough, with the exception of the iron work, was altogether
our relative&#8217;s workmanship too. And such was the history
of the rude implements of rural or domestic labour which
were consumed in the burning dwellings. But we anticipate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span></p>
<p>There is little of gaiety or enjoyment among the Highlanders
of Sutherland now. We spent a considerable time
for two several years among their thickly-clustered cottages
on the eastern coast, and saw how they live, and how it
happens that when years of comparative scarcity come on
they starve. Most of them saved, when in the interior, as
we have said, a little money; but the process has been reversed
here: in every instance in which they brought their
savings to the coast-side has the fund been dissipated. Each
cottage has from half an acre to an acre and half of corn
land attached to it&ndash;&ndash;just such patches as the Irish starve
upon. In some places, by dint of sore labour, the soil has
been considerably improved; and all that seems necessary
to render it worth the care of a family, would be just to increase
its area some ten or twelve times. In other cases,
however, increase would be no advantage. We find it
composed of a loose debris of granitic water-rolled pebbles
and ferruginous sand, that seemed destined to perpetual
barrenness. The rents, in every instance, seem moderate;
the money of the tenant flows towards the landlord in a
stream of not half the volume of that in which the money
of the landlord must flow towards the tenant when the poor-laws
shall be extended to Scotland. But no rent, in such
circumstances, can be really moderate. A clergyman, when
asked to say how many of his parishioners, in one of these
coast districts, realized <i>less</i> than sixpence a-day, replied,
that it would be a much easier matter for him to point out
how many of them realized <i>more</i> than sixpence, as this more
fortunate class were exceedingly few. And surely no rent
can be moderate that is paid by a man who realizes less
than sixpence a-day. It is the peculiar evil produced by
the change in Sutherland, that it has consigned the population
of the country to a condition in which no rent <i>can</i> be
moderate&ndash;&ndash;to a condition in which they but barely avoid
famine, when matters are at the best with them, and fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span>
into it in every instance in which the herring fishing, their
main and most precarious stay, partially fails, or their crops
are just a little more than usually scanty. They are in such
a state, that their very means of living are sources, not of
comfort, but of distress to them. When the fishing and
their crops are comparatively abundant, they live on the
bleak edge of want; while failure in either plunges them
into a state of intense suffering. And well are these Highlanders
aware of the true character of the revolution to
which they have been subjected. Our Poor-Law Commissioners
may find, in this land of growing pauperism, thousands
as poor as the people of Sutherland; but they will
find no class of the population who can so directly contrast
their present destitution with a state of comparative plenty
and enjoyment, or who, in consequence of possessing this
sad ability, are so deeply imbued with a too well-grounded
and natural discontent.</p>
<p>But we have not yet said how this ruinous revolution was
effected in Sutherland,&ndash;&ndash;how the aggravations of the <i>mode</i>,
if we may so speak, still fester in the recollections of the
people,&ndash;&ndash;or how thoroughly that policy of the lord of the
soil, through which he now seems determined to complete
the work of ruin which his predecessor began, harmonizes
with its worst details. We must first relate, however, a
disastrous change which took place, in the providence of
God, in the noble family of Sutherland, and which, though
it dates fully eighty years back, may be regarded as pregnant
with the disasters which afterwards befell the country.

<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER IV.</h3>
<p>Such of our readers as are acquainted with the memoir
of Lady Glenorchy, must remember a deeply melancholy
incident which occurred in the history of this excellent
woman, in connection with the noble family of Sutherland.
Her only sister had been married to William, seventeenth
Earl of Sutherland,&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;the last of the good Earls;&#8217; &#8216;a nobleman,&#8217;
says the Rev. Dr. Jones, in his Memoir, &#8216;who to the
finest person united all the dignity and amenity of manners
and character which give lustre to greatness.&#8217; But his sun
was destined soon to go down. Five years after his marriage,
which proved one of the happiest, and was blessed
with two children, the elder of the two, the young Lady
Catherine, a singularly engaging child, was taken from him
by death, in his old hereditary castle of Dunrobin. The
event deeply affected both parents, and preyed on their
health and spirits. It had taken place amid the gloom of
a severe northern winter, and in the solitude of the Highlands;
and, acquiescing in the advice of friends, the Earl
and his lady quitted the family seat, where there was so
much to remind them of their bereavement, and sought
relief in the more cheerful atmosphere of Bath. But they
were not to find it there. Shortly after their arrival, the
Earl was seized by a malignant fever, with which, upheld by
a powerful constitution, he struggled for fifty-four days, and
then expired. &#8216;For the first twenty-one days and nights of
these,&#8217; says Dr. Jones, &#8216;Lady Sutherland never left his bedside;
and then at last, overcome with fatigue, anxiety, and
grief, she sank an unavailing victim to an amiable but excessive
attachment, seventeen days before the death of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_416' name='page_416'></a>416</span>
lord.&#8217; The period, though not very remote, was one in
which the intelligence of events travelled slowly; and in
this instance the distraction of the family must have served
to retard it beyond the ordinary time. Her Ladyship&#8217;s
mother, when hastening from Edinburgh to her assistance,
alighted one day from her carriage at an inn, and, on
seeing two hearses standing by the wayside, inquired of an
attendant whose remains they contained? The remains,
was the reply, of Lord and Lady Sutherland, on their way
for interment to the Royal Chapel of Holyrood House.
And such was the first intimation which the lady received
of the death of her daughter and son-in-law.</p>
<p>The event was pregnant with disaster to Sutherland,
though many years elapsed ere the ruin which it involved
fell on that hapless county. The sole survivor and heir of
the family was a female infant of but a year old. Her
maternal grandmother, an ambitious, intriguing woman of
the world, had the chief share in her general training and
education; and she was brought up in the south of Scotland,
of which her grandmother was a native, far removed
from the influence of those genial sympathies with the
people of her clan, for which the old lords of Sutherland
had been so remarkable, and, what was a sorer evil still,
from the influence of the vitalities of that religion which,
for five generations together, her fathers had illustrated and
adorned. The special mode in which the disaster told first,
was through the patronages of the county, the larger part of
which are vested in the family of Sutherland. Some of the
old Earls had been content, as we have seen, to place
themselves on the level of the Christian men of their parishes,
and thus to unite with them in calling to their churches the
Christian ministers of their choice. They knew,&ndash;&ndash;what regenerate
natures can alone know with the proper emphasis,&ndash;&ndash;that
in Christ Jesus the vassal ranks with his lord, and
they conscientiously acted on the conviction. But matters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span>
were now regulated differently. The presentation supplanted
the call, and ministers came to be placed in the
parishes of Sutherland without the consent and contrary to
the will of the people. Churches, well filled hitherto, were
deserted by their congregations, just because a respectable
woman of the world, making free use of what she deemed
her own, had planted them with men of the world who
were only tolerably respectable; and in houses and barns
the devout men of the district learned to hold numerously-attended
Sabbath meetings for reading the Scriptures, and
mutual exhortation and prayer, as a sort of substitute for
the public services, in which they found they could no
longer join with profit. The spirit awakened by the old
Earls had survived themselves, and ran directly counter to
the policy of their descendant. Strongly attached to the
Establishment, the people, though they thus forsook their
old places of worship, still remained members of the national
Church, and travelled far in the summer season to attend
the better ministers of their own and the neighbouring
counties. We have been assured, too, from men whose
judgment we respect, that, under all their disadvantages,
religion continued peculiarly to flourish among them;&ndash;&ndash;a
deep-toned evangelism prevailed; so that perhaps the visible
Church throughout the world at the time could furnish no
more striking contrast than that which obtained between
the cold, bald, commonplace services of the pulpit in some
of these parishes, and the fervid prayers and exhortations
which give life and interest to these humble meetings of the
people. What a pity it is that differences such as these the
Duke of Sutherland cannot see!</p>
<p>The marriage of the young countess into a noble English
family was fraught with further disaster to the county.
There are many Englishmen quite intelligent enough to
perceive the difference between a smoky cottage of turf and
a whitewashed cottage of stone, whose judgment on their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span>
respective inhabitants would be of but little value. Sutherland,
as a country of <i>men</i>, stood higher at this period than
perhaps any other district in the British empire; but, as our
descriptions in the preceding chapter must have shown,&ndash;&ndash;and
we indulged in them mainly with a view to this part of
our subject,&ndash;&ndash;it by no means stood high as a country of
farms and cottages. The marriage of the Countess brought
a new set of eyes upon it,&ndash;&ndash;eyes accustomed to quite a
different face of things. It seemed a wild, rude country,
where all was wrong, and all had to be set right,&ndash;&ndash;a sort of
Russia on a small scale, that had just got another Peter the
Great to civilise it,&ndash;&ndash;or a sort of barbarous Egypt, with an
energetic Ali Pasha at its head. Even the vast wealth and
great liberality of the Stafford family militated against this
hapless county: it enabled them to treat it as the mere
subject of an interesting experiment, in which gain to themselves
was really no object,&ndash;&ndash;nearly as little so as if they
had resolved on dissecting a dog alive for the benefit of
science. It was a still further disadvantage, that they had
to carry on their experiment by the hands, and to watch its
first effects with the eyes, of others. The agonies of the dog
might have had their softening influence on a dissector who
held the knife himself; but there could be no such influence
exerted over him, did he merely issue orders to his footman
that the dissection should be completed, remaining himself,
meanwhile, out of sight and out of hearing. The plan
of improvement sketched out by his English family was a
plan exceedingly easy of conception. Here is a vast tract
of land, furnished with two distinct sources of wealth. Its
shores may be made the seats of extensive fisheries, and the
whole of its interior parcelled out into productive sheep-farms.
All is waste in its present state: it has no fisheries,
and two-thirds of its internal produce is consumed by the
inhabitants. It had contributed, for the use of the community
and the landlord, its large herds of black cattle; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_419' name='page_419'></a>419</span>
the English family saw, and, we believe, saw truly, that for
every one pound of beef which it produced, it could be made
to produce two pounds of mutton, and perhaps a pound of
fish in addition. And it was resolved, therefore, that the
inhabitants of the central districts, who, <i>as they were mere
Celts</i>, could not be transformed, it was held, into store-farmers,
should be marched down to the sea-side, there to
convert themselves into fishermen, on the shortest possible
notice, and that a few farmers of capital, of the industrious
Lowland race, should be invited to occupy the new subdivisions
of the interior.</p>
<p>And, pray, what objections can be urged against so liberal
and large-minded a scheme? The poor inhabitants of the
interior had <i>very</i> serious objections to urge against it.
Their humble dwellings were of their own rearing; it was
they themselves who had broken in their little fields from
the waste; from time immemorial, far beyond the reach of
history, had they possessed their mountain holdings,&ndash;&ndash;they
had defended them so well of old that the soil was still
virgin ground, in which the invader had found only a grave;
and their young men were now in foreign lands, fighting, at
the command of their chieftainess, the battles of their
country, not in the character of hired soldiers, but of men
who regarded these very holdings as their stake in the
quarrel. To them, then, the scheme seemed fraught with
the most flagrant, the most monstrous injustice. Were it
to be suggested by some Chartist convention in a time of
revolution, that Sutherland might be still further improved&ndash;&ndash;that
it was really a piece of great waste to suffer the revenues
of so extensive a district to be squandered by one individual&ndash;&ndash;that
it would be better to appropriate them to the
use of the community in general&ndash;&ndash;that the community in
general might be still further benefited by the removal of
the one said individual from Dunrobin to a road-side, where
he might be profitably employed in breaking stones&ndash;&ndash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_420' name='page_420'></a>420</span>
that this new arrangement could not be entered on too
soon&ndash;&ndash;the noble Duke would not be a whit more astonished,
or rendered a whit more indignant, by the scheme, than
were the Highlanders of Sutherland by the scheme of his
predecessor.</p>
<p>The reader must keep in view, therefore, that if atrocities
unexampled in Britain for at least a century were perpetrated
in the <i>clearing</i> of Sutherland, there was a species of
at least passive resistance on the part of the people (for
active resistance there was none), which in some degree
provoked them. Had the Highlanders, on receiving orders,
marched down to the sea-coast, and become fishermen, with
the readiness with which a regiment deploys on review day,
the atrocities would, we doubt not, have been much fewer.
But though the orders were very distinct, the Highlanders
were very unwilling to obey; and the severities formed
merely a part of the means through which the necessary
obedience was ultimately secured. We shall instance a
single case, as illustrative of the process. In the month of
March 1814, a large proportion of the Highlanders of Farr
and Kildonan, two parishes in Sutherland, were summoned
to quit their farms in the following May. In a few days
after, the surrounding heaths on which they pastured their
cattle, and from which at that season the sole supply of
herbage is derived (for in those northern districts the grass
springs late, and the cattle-feeder in the spring months
depends chiefly on the heather), were set on fire and burnt
up. There was that sort of policy in the stroke which men
deem allowable in a state of war. The starving cattle went
roaming over the burnt pastures, and found nothing to eat.
Many of them perished, and the greater part of what remained,
though in miserable condition, the Highlanders
had to sell perforce. Most of the able-bodied men were
engaged in this latter business at a distance from home,
when the dreaded term-day came on. The pasturage had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_421' name='page_421'></a>421</span>
been destroyed before the legal term, and while, in even the
eye of the law, it was still the property of the poor Highlanders;
but ere disturbing them in their dwellings, term-day
was suffered to pass. The work of demolition then
began. A numerous party of men, with a factor at their
head, entered the district, and commenced pulling down
the houses over the heads of the inhabitants. In an extensive
tract of country not a human dwelling was left standing,
and then, the more effectually to prevent their temporary
re-erection, the destroyers set fire to the wreck. In one day
were the people deprived of home and shelter, and left
exposed to the elements. Many deaths are said to have
ensued from alarm, fatigue, and cold. Pregnant women
were taken with premature labour in the open air. There
were old men who took to the woods and rocks in a state
of partial insanity. An aged bedridden man, named Macbeath,
had his house unroofed over his head, and was left
exposed to wind and rain till death put a period to his
sufferings. Another man lying ill of a fever met with no
tenderer treatment, but in his case the die turned up life.
A bedridden woman, nearly a hundred years of age, had
her house fired over her head, and ere she could be extricated
from the burning wreck, the sheets in which she was
carried were on fire. She survived but for five days after.
In a critique on the work of Sismondi, which appeared a
few months since in the <i>Westminster Review</i>, the writer tells
us, &#8216;it has even been said that an old man, having refused
to quit his cabin, perished in the flames.&#8217; But such was not
the case. The constituted authorities interfered; a precognition
was taken by the Sheriff-substitute of the county,
and the case tried before the Justiciary Court at Inverness;
but the trial terminated in the acquittal of the pannels.
There was no punishable crime proven to attach to the
agents of the proprietor.</p>
<p>Their acquittal was followed by scenes of a similar
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_422' name='page_422'></a>422</span>
character with the scene described, and of even greater
atrocity. But we must borrow the description of one of
these from the historian of the <i>clearing</i> of Sutherland,&ndash;&ndash;Donald
M&#8217;Leod, a native of the county, and himself a
sufferer in the experimental process to which it was subjected:&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8216;The work of devastation was begun by setting fire to the
houses of the small tenants in extensive districts&ndash;&ndash;Farr,
Rogart, Golspie, and the whole parish of Kildonan. I was
an eye-witness of the scene. The calamity came on the
people quite unexpectedly. Strong parties for each district,
furnished with faggots and other combustibles, rushed on
the dwellings of the devoted people, and immediately commenced
setting fire to them, proceeding in their work with
the greatest rapidity, till about three hundred houses were
in flames. Little or no time was given for the removal of
persons or property&ndash;&ndash;the consternation and confusion were
extreme&ndash;&ndash;the people striving to remove the sick and helpless
before the fire should reach them&ndash;&ndash;next struggling to
save the most valuable of their effects&ndash;&ndash;the cries of the
women and children&ndash;&ndash;the roaring of the affrighted cattle,
hunted by the dogs of the shepherds amid the smoke and
the fire&ndash;&ndash;altogether composed a scene that completely
baffles description. A dense cloud of smoke enveloped the
whole country by day, and even extended far on the sea.
At night, an awfully grand but terrific scene presented itself&ndash;&ndash;all
the houses in an extensive district in flames at once.
I myself ascended a height about eleven o&#8217;clock in the
evening, and counted two hundred and fifty blazing houses,
many of the owners of which were my relations, and all of
whom I personally knew, but whose present condition I
could not tell. The conflagration lasted six days, till the
whole of the dwellings were reduced to ashes or smoking
ruins. During one of these days, a boat lost her way in the
dense smoke as she approached the shore, but at night she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_423' name='page_423'></a>423</span>
was enabled to reach a landing-place by the light of the
flames.&#8217;</p>
<p>But, to employ the language of Southey,</p>
<div class="poem">
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:left'><span class="leadquote">&#8216;</span>Things such as these, we know, must be<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.5em;'>At every famous victory.&#8217;</span><br /></p>
</div>
<p>And in this instance the victory of the lord of the soil over
the children of the soil was signal and complete. In little
more than nine years a population of fifteen thousand individuals
were removed from the interior of Sutherland to
its sea-coasts, or had emigrated to America. The inland
districts were converted into deserts, through which the
traveller may take a long day&#8217;s journey, amid ruins that
still bear the scathe of fire, and grassy patches betraying,
when the evening sun casts aslant its long deep shadows,
the half-effaced lines of the plough. The writer of the
singularly striking passage we have just quoted, revisited
his native place (Kildonan) in the year 1828, and attended
divine service in the parish church. A numerous and devout
congregation had once worshipped there: the congregation
now consisted of eight shepherds and their <i>dogs</i>. In a neighbouring
district&ndash;&ndash;the barony of Strathnaver, a portion of the
parish of Farr&ndash;&ndash;the church, no longer found necessary, was
razed to the ground. The timber was carried away to be
used in the erection of an inn, and the minister&#8217;s house converted
into the dwelling of a fox-hunter. &#8216;A woman well
known in the parish,&#8217; says M&#8217;Leod, &#8216;happening to traverse
the Strath the year after the burning, was asked, on her return,
What news? &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said she, &#8220;<i>sgeul bronach, sgeul
bronach!</i> sad news, sad news! I have seen the timber of
our kirk covering the inn at Altnaharran; I have seen the
kirkyard, where our friends are mouldering, filled with tarry
sheep, and Mr. Sage&#8217;s study-room a kennel for Robert Gun&#8217;s
dogs.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_424' name='page_424'></a>424</span></p>
<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER V.</h3>
<p>Let us follow, for a little, the poor Highlanders of Sutherland
to the sea-coast. It would be easy dwelling on the
terrors of their expulsion, and multiplying facts of horror;
but had there been no permanent deterioration effected in
their condition, these, all harrowing and repulsive as they
were, would have mattered less. Sutherland would have
soon recovered the burning up of a few hundred hamlets,
or the loss of a few bedridden old people, who would have
died as certainly under cover, though perhaps a few months
later, as when exposed to the elements in the open air.
Nay, had it lost a thousand of its best men in the way in
which it lost so many at the storming of New Orleans, the
blank ere now would have been completely filled up. The
calamities of fire or of decimation even, however distressing
in themselves, never yet ruined a country: no calamity
ruins a country that leaves the surviving inhabitants to develope,
in their old circumstances, their old character and
resources.</p>
<p>In one of the eastern eclogues of Collins, where two
shepherds are described as flying for their lives before the
troops of a ruthless invader, we see with how much of the
terrible the imagination of a poet could invest the evils of
war, when aggravated by pitiless barbarity. Fertile as that
imagination was, however, there might be found new circumstances
to heighten the horrors of the scene&ndash;&ndash;circumstances
beyond the reach of invention&ndash;&ndash;in the retreat of the
Sutherland Highlanders from the smoking ruins of their
cottages to their allotments on the coast. We have heard
of one man, named M&#8217;Kay, whose family, at the time of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_425' name='page_425'></a>425</span>
the greater conflagration referred to by M&#8217;Leod, were all
lying ill of fever, who had to carry two of his sick children
on his back a distance of twenty-five miles. We have heard
of the famished people blackening the shores, like the crew
of some vessel wrecked on an inhospitable coast, that they
might sustain life by the shell-fish and sea-weed laid bare
by the ebb. Many of their allotments, especially on the
western coast, were barren in the extreme&ndash;&ndash;unsheltered by
bush or tree, and exposed to the sweeping sea-winds, and,
in time of tempest, to the blighting spray; and it was found
a matter of the extremest difficulty to keep the few cattle
which they had retained, from wandering, especially in the
night-time, into the better sheltered and more fertile interior.
The poor animals were intelligent enough to read
a practical comment on the nature of the change effected;
and, from the harshness of the shepherds to whom the care
of the interior had been entrusted, they served materially to
add to the distress of their unhappy masters. They were
getting continually impounded; and vexatious fines, in the
form of trespass-money, came thus to be wrung from the
already impoverished Highlanders. Many who had no
money to give were obliged to relieve them by depositing
some of their few portable articles of value, such as bed or
body clothes, or, more distressing still, watches and rings
and pins&ndash;&ndash;the only relics, in not a few instances, of brave
men whose bones were mouldering under the fatal rampart
at New Orleans, or in the arid sands of Egypt&ndash;&ndash;on that
spot of proud recollection, where the invincibles of Napoleon
went down before the Highland bayonet. Their first
efforts as fishermen were what might be expected from a
rural people unaccustomed to the sea. The shores of
Sutherland, for immense tracts together, are iron-bound,
and much exposed&ndash;&ndash;open on the eastern coast to the
waves of the German Ocean, and on the north and west
to the long roll of the Atlantic. There could not be more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_426' name='page_426'></a>426</span>
perilous seas for the unpractised boatman to take his first
lessons on; but though the casualties were numerous, and
the loss of life great, many of the younger Highlanders
became expert fishermen. The experiment was harsh in
the extreme, but so far, at least, it succeeded. It lies open,
however, to other objections than those which have been
urged against it on the score of its inhumanity.</p>
<p>The reader must be acquainted with Goldsmith&#8217;s remarks
on the herring fishery of his days. &#8216;A few years ago,&#8217; he
says, &#8216;the herring fishing employed all Grub Street; it was
the topic in every coffee-house, and the burden of every
ballad. We were to drag up oceans of gold from the bottom
of the sea; we were to supply all Europe with herrings upon
our own terms. At present, however, we hear no more of
all this; we have fished up very little gold that I can learn;
nor do we furnish the world with herrings, as was expected.&#8217;
We have, in this brief passage, a history of all the more
sanguine expectations which have been founded on herring
fisheries. There is no branch of industry so calculated to
awaken the hopes of the speculator, or so suited to disappoint
them. So entirely is this the case, that were we desirous
to reduce an industrious people to the lowest stage of
wretchedness compatible with industry, we would remove
them to some barren district, and there throw them on the
resources of this fishery exclusively. The employments of
the herring fisher have all the uncertainty of the ventures of
the gambler. He has first to lay down, if we may so speak,
a considerable stake, for his drift of nets and his boat involve
a very considerable outlay of capital; and if successful,
and if in general the fishery be <i>not</i> successful, the <i>take</i>
of a single week may more than remunerate him. A single
cast of his nets may bring him in thirty guineas and more.
The die turns up in his favour, and he sweeps the board.
And hence those golden dreams of the speculator so happily
described by Goldsmith. But year after year may pass, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_427' name='page_427'></a>427</span>
the run of luck be against the fisherman. A fishing generally
good at all the stations gluts the market, necessarily
limited in its demands to an average supply, and, from the
bulk and weight of the commodity, not easily extended to
distant parts: and the herring merchant first, and the fisherman
next, find that they have been labouring hard to little
purpose. Again, a fishing under average, from the eccentric
character of the fish, is found almost always to benefit a
few, and to ruin a great many. The average deficiency is
never equally spread over the fishermen; one sweeps the
board&ndash;&ndash;another loses all. Nor are the cases few in which
the accustomed shoal wholly deserts a tract of coast for
years together; and thus the lottery, precarious at all times,
becomes a lottery in which there are only blanks to be
drawn. The wealthy speculator might perhaps watch such
changes, and by supplementing the deficiency of one year
by the abundance of another, give to the whole a character
of average; but alas for the poor labouring man placed
in such circumstances! The yearly disbursements of our
Scottish Fishery Board, in the way of assistance to poverty-struck
fishermen, unable even to repair their boats, testify
all too tangibly that they cannot regulate their long runs of
ill luck by their temporary successes! And if such be the
case among our hereditary fishermen of the north, who derive
more than half their sustenance from the white fishery, how
much more must it affect those fishermen of Sutherland,
who, having no market for their white fish in the depopulated
interior, and no merchants settled among them to
find markets farther away, have to depend exclusively on
their herring fishing! The experiment which precipitated
the population of the country on its barer skirts, as some
diseases precipitate the humours on the extremities, would
have been emphatically a disastrous one, so far at least as the
people were concerned, even did it involve no large amount
of human suffering, and no deterioration of character.

<p>One of the first writers, of unquestioned respectability,
who acquainted the public with the true character of the
revolution which had been effected in Sutherland, was the
late General Stewart of Garth. He was, we believe, the
first man&ndash;&ndash;and the fact says something for his shrewdness&ndash;&ndash;who
saw a coming poor-law looming through the <i>clearing</i> of
Sutherland. His statements are exceedingly valuable; his
inferences almost always just. The General&ndash;&ndash;a man of
probity and nice honour&ndash;&ndash;had such an ability of estimating
the value of moral excellence in a people, as the originators
of the revolution had of estimating the antagonist merits of
double pounds of mutton and single pounds of beef. He
had seen printed representations on the subject&ndash;&ndash;tissues of
hollow falsehood, that have since been repeated in newspapers
and reviews; and though unacquainted with the
facts at the time, he saw sufficient reason to question their
general correctness, from the circumstance that he found in
them the character of the people, with which no man could
be better acquainted, vilified and traduced. The General
saw one leviathan falsehood running through the whole, and,
on the strength of the old adage, naturally suspected the
company in which he found it. And so, making minute
and faithful inquiry, he published the results at which he
arrived. He refers to the mode of ejectment by the torch.
He next goes on to show how some of the ejected tenants
were allowed small allotments of moor on the coast side, of
from half an acre to two acres in extent, which it was their
task to break into corn land; and how that, because many
patches of green appear in this way, where all was russet
before, the change has been much eulogized as improvement.
We find him remarking further, with considerable
point and shrewdness, that &#8216;many persons are, however,
inclined to doubt the advantages of improvements which
call for such frequent apologies,&#8217; and that, &#8216;if the advantage
to the people were so evident, or if more lenient measures
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_429' name='page_429'></a>429</span>
had been pursued, vindication could not have been necessary.&#8217;
The General knew how to pass from the green spots
themselves to the condition of those who tilled them. The
following passage must strike all acquainted with the Highlanders
of Sutherland as a true representation of the circumstances
to which they have been reduced:</p>
<p>&#8216;Ancient respectable tenants who have passed the greater
part of life in the enjoyment of abundance, and in the exercise
of hospitality and charity, possessing stock of ten, twenty,
and thirty breeding cows, with the usual proportion of other
stock, are now pining on one or two acres of bad land, with
one or two starved cows; and for this accommodation a
calculation is made, that they must support their families,
and pay the rent of their lots, not from the produce, but
from the sea, thus drawing a rent which the land cannot
afford. When the herring fishing succeeds, they generally
satisfy the landlord, whatever privations they may suffer;
but when the fishing fails, they fall into arrears. The herring
fishing, always precarious, has for a succession of years
been very defective, and this class of people are reduced to
extreme misery. At first, some of them possessed capital,
from converting their farm-stock into cash, but this has been
long exhausted; and it is truly distressing to view their
general poverty, aggravated by their having once enjoyed
abundance and independence.&#8217;</p>
<p>Some of the removals to which we have referred took
place during that group of scarce seasons in which the
year 1816 was so prominent; but the scarcity which these
induced served merely to render the other sufferings of the
people more intense, and was lost sight of in the general
extent of the calamity. Another group of hard seasons
came on,&ndash;&ndash;one of those groups which seem of such certain
and yet of such irregular occurrence in our climate, that
though they have attracted notice from the days of Bacon
downwards, they have hitherto resisted all attempts to include
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_430' name='page_430'></a>430</span>
them in some definite cycle. The summer and
harvest of 1835 were the last of a series of fine summers
and abundant harvests; and for six years after there was
less than the usual heat, and more than the usual rain.
Science, in connection with agriculture, has done much
for us in the low country, and so our humbler population
were saved from the horrors of a dearth of food; but on
the green patches which girdle the shores of Sutherland,
and which have been esteemed such wonderful improvements,
science had done and could do nothing. The
people had been sinking lower and lower during the previous
twenty years, and what would have been great hardship
before had become famine now. One feels at times
that it may be an advantage to have lived among the
humbler people. We have been enabled, in consequence,
to detect many such gross misstatements as those with
which the apologists of the disastrous revolution effected
in Sutherland have attempted to gloss over the ruin of that
country. In other parts of the Highlands, especially in
the Hebrides, the failure of the kelp trade did much to
impoverish the inhabitants; but in the Highlands of Sutherland
the famine was the effect of <i>improvement</i> alone.</p>
<p>The writer of these chapters saw how a late, untoward
year operates on the bleak shores of the north-western
Highlands, when spending a season there a good many
years ago. He found what only a few twelvemonths previous
had been a piece of dark moor, laid out into minute
patches of corn, and bearing a dense population. The
herring fishing had failed for the two seasons before, and
the poor cottars were, in consequence, in arrears with their
rent; but the crops had been tolerable; and though their
stores of meal and potatoes were all exhausted at the time
of our coming among them (the month of June), and though
no part of the growing crop was yet fit for use, the white
fishing was abundant, and a training of hardship had enabled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_431' name='page_431'></a>431</span>
them to subsist on fish exclusively. Their corn shot in the
genial sunshine, and gave fair promise, and their potatoes
had become far enough advanced to supplement their all
too meagre meals, when, after a terrible thunder-storm, the
fine weather broke up, and for thirteen weeks together there
scarce passed a day without its baffling winds and its heavy
chilling showers. The oats withered without ripening; the
hardy bear might be seen rustling on all the more exposed
slopes, light as the common rye-grass of our hay-fields,
the stalks, in vast proportion, shorn of the ears. It was
only in a very few of the more sheltered places that it
yielded a scanty return of a dark-coloured and shrivelled
grain. And to impart a still deeper shade to the prospects
of the poor Highlanders, the herring fishery failed as signally
as in the previous years. There awaited them all too obviously
a whole half year of inevitable famine, unless Lowland
charity interfered in their behalf. And the recurrence
of this state of things no amount of providence or exertion
on their own part, when placed in such circumstances, can
obviate or prevent. It was a conviction of this character,
based on experience, which led the writer of these remarks
to state, when giving evidence before the present Poor-Law
Commissioners for Scotland, that though opposed to the
principle of legal assessment generally, he could yet see no
other mode of reaching the destitution of the Highlands.
Our humane Scottish law compels the man who sends
another man to prison to support him there, just because
it is held impossible that within the walls of a prison a man
can support himself. Should the principle alter, if, instead
of sending him to a prison, he banishes him to a bleak,
inhospitable coast, where, unless he receives occasional
support from others, he must inevitably perish?</p>
<p>The sufferings of the people of Sutherland during the
first of these years of destitution (1836), we find strikingly
described by M&#8217;Leod:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_432' name='page_432'></a>432</span></p>
<p>&#8216;In this year,&#8217; says the author, &#8216;the crops all over Britain
were deficient, having bad weather for growing and ripening,
and still worse for gathering in. But in the Highlands they
were an entire failure; and on the untoward spots, occupied
by the Sutherland small tenants, there was literally nothing
fit for human subsistence. And to add to the calamity, the
weather had prevented them from securing the peats, their
only fuel; so that, to their previous state of exhaustion,
cold and hunger were to be superadded. The sufferings
endured by the poor Highlanders in the succeeding winter
truly beggar description. Even the herring fishing had
failed, and consequently their credit in Caithness, which
depended on its success, was at an end. Any little provision
they might be able to procure was of the most
inferior and unwholesome description. It was no uncommon
thing to see people searching among the snow
for the frosted potatoes to eat in order to preserve life.
As the harvest had been disastrous, so the winter was uncommonly
boisterous and severe, and consequently little
could be obtained from the sea to mitigate the calamity.
The distress rose to such a height as to cause a sensation
all over the island; and there arose a general cry for
Government interference, to save the people from death
by famine.&#8217;</p>
<p>Public meetings were held, private subscriptions entered
into, large funds collected, the British people responded to
the cry of their suffering fellow-subjects, and relief was
extended to every portion of the Highlands except one.
Alas for poor Sutherland! There, it was said, the charity
of the country was not required, as the noble and wealthy
proprietors had themselves resolved to interfere; and as
this statement was circulated extensively through the public
prints, and sedulously repeated at all public meetings, the
mind of the community was set quite at rest on the matter.
And interfere the proprietors at length did. Late in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_433' name='page_433'></a>433</span>
spring of 1837, after sufferings the most incredible had
been endured, and disease and death had been among the
wretched people, they received a scanty supply of meal
and seed-corn, for which, though vaunted at the time as
a piece of munificent charity, the greater part of them had
afterwards to pay.</p>
<p>In the next chapter we shall endeavour bringing these
facts to bear on the cause of the Free Church in Sutherland.
We close for the present by adding just one curious
fact more. We have already shown how the bleak moors
of Sutherland have been mightily improved by the revolution
which ruined its people. They bear many green patches
which were brown before. Now it so happened that rather
more than ten years ago, the idea struck the original improvers,
that as green was an improvement on brown, so
far as the moors were concerned, white would be an equally
decided improvement on black, so far as the houses were
concerned. An order was accordingly issued, in the name
of the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland, that all the small
tenants on both sides the public road, where it stretches on
the northern coast from the confines of Reay to the Kyle
of Tongue, a distance of about thirty miles, should straightway
build themselves new houses of stone and mortar,
according to a prescribed plan and specification. Pharaoh&#8217;s
famous order could not have bred greater consternation.
But the only alternative given was summed up in the magic
word <i>removal</i>; and the poor Highlanders, dejected, tamed,
broken in spirit as in means, well knew from experience
what the magic word meant. And so, as their prototypes
set themselves to gather stubble for their bricks, the poor
Highlanders began to build. We again quote from
M&#8217;Leod:</p>
<p>&#8216;Previous to this, in the year 1829, I and my family had
been forced away, like others, being particularly obnoxious
to those in authority for sometimes showing an inclination
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_434' name='page_434'></a>434</span>
to oppose their tyranny, and therefore we had to be made
examples of to frighten the rest; but in 1833 I made a tour
of the district, when the building was going on, and shall
endeavour to describe a small part of what met my eye on
that occasion. In one locality (and this was a specimen of
the rest) I saw fourteen different squads of masons at work,
with the natives attending them. Old grey-headed men,
worn down by previous hardship and present want, were
to be seen carrying stones, and wheeling them and other
materials on barrows, or conveying them on their backs to
the buildings, and with their tottering limbs and trembling
hands straining to raise them on the walls. The young
men also, after toiling all night at sea endeavouring for
subsistence, were obliged to yield their exhausted frames to
the labours of the day. Even female labour could not be
dispensed with; the strong as well as the weak, the delicate
and sickly, and (shame to their oppressors) even the pregnant,
barefooted and scantily clothed, were obliged to join
in those rugged, unfeminine labours. In one instance I
saw the husband quarrying stones, and the wife and children
dragging them along in an old cart to the building.
Such were the building scenes of that period. The poor
people had often to give the last morsel of food they
possessed to feed the masons, and subsist on shell-fish
themselves. This went on for several years, in the course
of which many hundreds of these houses were erected on
unhospitable spots unfit for a human residence.&#8217;</p>
<p>We add another extract from the same writer:</p>
<p>&#8216;It might be thought,&#8217; adds M&#8217;Leod, &#8216;that the design of
forcing the people to build such houses was to provide for
their comfort and accommodation, but there seems to have
been quite a different object,&ndash;&ndash;which, I believe, was the true
motive,&ndash;&ndash;and that was to hide the misery that prevailed.
There had been a great sensation created in the public
mind by the cruelties exercised in these districts; and it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_435' name='page_435'></a>435</span>
was thought that a number of neat white houses, ranged on
each side of the road, would take the eye of strangers and
visitors, and give a practical contradiction to the rumours
afloat. Hence the poor creatures were forced to resort to
such means, and to endure such hardships and privations
as I have described, to carry the scheme into effect. And
after they had spent their remaining all, and more than
their all, on the erection of these houses, and involved
themselves in debt, for which they have been harassed and
pursued ever since, what are these erections but whitened
tombs! many of them now ten years in existence, and still
without proper doors or windows, destitute of furniture and
of comfort,&ndash;&ndash;the unhappy lairs of a heart-broken, squalid,
fast-degenerating race.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_436' name='page_436'></a>436</span></p>
<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<p>We have exhibited to our readers, in the <i>clearing</i> of Sutherland,
a process of ruin so thoroughly disastrous, that it
might be deemed scarce possible to render it more complete.
And yet, with all its apparent completeness, it admitted
of a supplementary process. To employ one of the
striking figures of Scripture, it was possible to grind into
powder what had been previously broken into fragments,&ndash;&ndash;to
degrade the poor inhabitants to a still lower level than
that on which they had been so cruelly precipitated,&ndash;&ndash;though
persons of a not very original cast of mind might
have found it difficult to say how; and the Duke of Sutherland
has been ingenious enough to fall on exactly the one
proper expedient for supplementing their ruin. All in
mere circumstance and situation that could lower and
deteriorate, had been present as ingredients in the first
process; but there still remained for the people, however
reduced to poverty or broken in spirit, all in religion that
consoles and ennobles. Sabbath-days came round with
their humanizing influences; and, under the teachings of
the gospel, the poor and oppressed looked longingly forward
to a future scene of being, in which there is no poverty and
no oppression. They still possessed, amid their misery,
something positively good, of which it was possible to
deprive them; and hence the ability derived to the present
lord of Sutherland, of deepening and rendering more signal
the ruin accomplished by his predecessor.</p>
<p>Napoleon, when on the eve of re-establishing Popery in
France, showed his conviction of the importance of national
religions, by remarking that, did there exist no ready-made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_437' name='page_437'></a>437</span>
religion to serve his turn, he would be under the necessity
of making one on purpose. And his remark, though perhaps
thrown into this form merely to give it point, and
render it striking, has been instanced as a proof that
he could not have considered the matter very profoundly.
It has been said, and said truly, that religions of stamina
enough to be even politically useful cannot be <i>made</i>: that
it is comparatively easy to gain great battles, and frame
important laws; but that to create belief lay beyond the
power of even a Napoleon. France, instead of crediting
his manufactured religion, would have laughed at both him
and it. The Duke of Sutherland has, however, taken upon
himself a harder task than the one to which Napoleon
could refer, probably in joke. His aim seems to be, not
the comparatively simple one of making a new religion
where no religion existed before, but of making men already
firm in their religious convictions believe that to be a
religion which they believe to be no such thing. His
undertaking involves a <i>discharging</i> as certainly as an <i>injecting</i>
process,&ndash;&ndash;the erasure of an existing belief, as certainly
as the infusion of an antagonistic belief that has no existence.
We have shown how evangelism took root and
grew in Sutherland, as the only form of Christianity which
its people could recognise; how the antagonist principle of
Moderatism they failed to recognise as Christianity at all;
and how, when the latter was obtruded into their pulpits,
they withdrew from the churches in which their fathers had
worshipped, for they could regard them as churches no
longer, and held their prayer and fellowship meetings in
their own homes, or travelled far to attend the ministrations
of clergymen in whose mission they <i>could</i> believe. We
have shown that this state of feeling and belief still pervades
the county. It led to an actual disruption between
its evangelized people and its moderate clergy, long ere the
disruption of last May took place: that important event has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_438' name='page_438'></a>438</span>
had but the effect of marshalling them into one compact
body under a new name. They are adherents of the Free
Church now, just because they have been adherents to its
principles for the last two centuries. And to shake them
loose from this adherence is the object of his Grace; to
reverse the belief of ages; to render them indifferent to that
which they feel and believe to be religion; and to make
them regard as religion that which they know to be none.
His task is harder by a great deal than that to which
Napoleon barely ventured to advert; and how very coarse
and repulsive his purposed means of accomplishing it!</p>
<p>These harmonize but too well with the mode in which
the interior of Sutherland was cleared, and the improved
cottages of its sea-coasts erected. The plan has its two
items. No sites are to be granted in the district for Free
churches, and no dwelling-houses for Free Church ministers.
The climate is severe; the winters prolonged and stormy;
the roads which connect the chief seats of population with
the neighbouring counties dreary and long. May not ministers
and people be eventually worn out in this way? Such
is the portion of the plan which his Grace and his Grace&#8217;s
creatures can afford to present to the light. But there are
supplementary items of a somewhat darker kind. The
poor cottars are, in the great majority of cases, tenants at
will; and there has been much pains taken to inform them,
that to the crime of entertaining and sheltering a protesting
minister, the penalty of ejection from their holdings must
inevitably attach. The laws of Charles have again returned
in this unhappy district; and free and tolerating
Scotland has got, in the nineteenth century, as in the
seventeenth, its intercommuned ministers. We shall not
say that the intimation has emanated from the Duke. It is
the misfortune of such men that there creep around them
creatures whose business it is to anticipate their wishes;
but who, at times, doubtless, instead of anticipating, misinterpret
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_439' name='page_439'></a>439</span>
them; and who, even when not very much mistaken,
impart to whatever they do the impress of their own
low and menial natures, and thus exaggerate in the act the
intention of their masters. We do not say, therefore, that the
intimation has emanated from the Duke; but this we say,
that an exemplary Sutherlandshire minister of the Protesting
Church, who resigned his worldly all for the sake of his
principles, had lately to travel, that he might preach to his
attached people, a long journey of forty-five miles outwards,
and as much in return, and all this without taking
shelter under the cover of a roof, or without partaking of
any other refreshment than that furnished by the slender
store of provisions which he had carried with him from his
new home. Willingly would the poor Highlanders have
received him at any risk; but knowing from experience
what a Sutherlandshire removal means, he preferred enduring
any amount of hardship, rather than that the hospitality
of his people should be made the occasion of their
ruin. We have already adverted to the case of a lady of
Sutherland threatened with ejection from her home because
she had extended the shelter of her roof to one of the
protesting clergy&ndash;&ndash;an aged and venerable man, who had
quitted the neighbouring manse, his home for many years,
because he could no longer enjoy it in consistency with his
principles; and we have shown that that aged and venerable
man was the lady&#8217;s own father. What amount of
oppression of a smaller and more petty character may not
be expected in the circumstances, when cases such as
these are found to stand but a very little over the ordinary
level?</p>
<p>The meannesses to which ducal hostility can stoop in this
hapless district impress with a feeling of surprise. In the
parish of Dornoch, for instance, where his Grace is fortunately
not the sole landowner, there has been a site
procured on the most generous terms from Sir George
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_440' name='page_440'></a>440</span>
Gun Munro of Poyntzfield; and this gentleman&ndash;&ndash;believing
himself possessed of a hereditary right to a quarry, which,
though on the Duke&#8217;s ground, had been long resorted to
by the proprietors of the district generally&ndash;&ndash;instructed the
builder to take from it the stones which he needed. Here,
however, his Grace interfered. Never had the quarry been
prohibited before; but on this occasion a stringent interdict
arrested its use. If his Grace could not prevent a
hated Free Church from arising in the district, he could at
least add to the <i>expense</i> of its erection. We have even heard
that the portion of the building previously erected had to
be pulled down, and the stones returned.</p>
<p>How are we to account for a hostility so determined, and
that can stoop so low? In two different ways, we are of
opinion, and in both have the people of Scotland a direct
interest. Did his Grace entertain a very intense regard for
Established Presbytery, it is probable that he himself would
be a Presbyterian of the Establishment. But such is not
the case. The Church into which he would so fain force
the people has been long since deserted by himself. The
secret of the course which he pursues can have no connection
therefore with religious motive or belief. It can be
no proselytizing spirit that misleads his Grace. Let us
remark, in the first place,&ndash;&ndash;rather, however, in the way of
embodying a fact than imputing a motive,&ndash;&ndash;that with his
present views, and in his present circumstances, it may not
seem particularly his Grace&#8217;s interest to make the county
of Sutherland a happy or desirable home to the people of
Sutherland. It may not seem his Grace&#8217;s interest that the
population of the district should increase. The <i>clearing</i> of
the sea-coast may seem as little prejudicial to his Grace&#8217;s
welfare now, as the <i>clearing</i> of the interior seemed adverse
to the interests of his predecessor thirty years ago; nay, it
is quite possible that his Grace may be led to regard the
<i>clearing</i> of the coast as the better and more important <i>clearing</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_441' name='page_441'></a>441</span>
of the two. Let it not be forgotten that a poor-law
hangs over Scotland; that the shores of Sutherland are
covered with what seems one vast straggling village, inhabited
by an impoverished and ruined people; and that
the coming assessment may yet fall so weighty, that the
extra profits derived to his Grace from his large sheep-farms,
may go but a small way in supporting his extra
paupers. It is not in the least improbable that he may
live to find the revolution effected by his predecessor taking
to itself the form, not of a crime&ndash;&ndash;for that would be
nothing&ndash;&ndash;but of a disastrous and very terrible blunder.</p>
<p>There is another remark which may prove not unworthy
the consideration of the reader. Ever since the completion
of the fatal experiment which ruined Sutherland, the noble
family through which it was originated and carried on have
betrayed the utmost jealousy of having its real results made
public. Volumes of special pleading have been written on
the subject; pamphlets have been published; laboured
articles have been inserted in widely-spread reviews;
statistical accounts have been watched over with the most
careful surveillance. If the misrepresentations of the press
could have altered the matter of fact, famine would not
have been gnawing the vitals of Sutherland in every year
just a little less abundant than its fellows, nor would the
dejected and oppressed people be feeding their discontent,
amid present misery, with the recollections of a happier
past. If a singularly well-conditioned and wholesome district
of country has been converted into one wide ulcer of
wretchedness and wo, it must be confessed that the sore
has been carefully bandaged up from the public eye; that
if there has been little done for its cure, there has at least
been much done for its concealment. Now, be it remembered
that the Free Church threatens to insert a <i>tent</i>
into this wound, and so keep it open. It has been said
that the Gaelic language removes a district more effectually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_442' name='page_442'></a>442</span>
from the influence of English opinion than an ocean of
three thousand miles, and that the British public know
better what is doing in New York than what is doing in
Lewis and Skye. And hence one cause, at least, of the
thick obscurity that has so long enveloped the miseries
which the poor Highlander has had to endure, and the
oppressions to which he has been subjected. The Free
Church threatens to <i>translate</i> her wrongs into English, and
to give them currency in the general mart of opinion. She
might possibly enough be no silent spectator of conflagrations
such as those which characterized the first general
improvement of Sutherland, nor yet of such Egyptian
schemes of house-building as that which formed part of the
improvements of a later plan. She might be somewhat apt
to betray the real state of the district, and thus render
laborious misrepresentation of little avail. She might effect
a diversion in the cause of the people, and shake the
foundations of the hitherto despotic power which has so
long weighed them down. She might do for Sutherland
what Cobbett promised to do for it, but what Cobbett had
not character enough to accomplish, and what he did not
live even to attempt. A combination of circumstances
have conspired to vest in a Scottish proprietor, in this
northern district, a more despotic power than even the
most absolute monarchs of the Continent possess; and it
is, perhaps, no great wonder that that proprietor should be
jealous of the introduction of an element which threatens,
it may seem, materially to lessen it. And so he struggles
hard to exclude the Free Church, and, though no member
of the Establishment himself, declaims warmly in its behalf.
Certain it is, that from the Establishment, as now constituted,
he can have nothing to fear, and the people
nothing to hope.</p>
<p>After what manner may his Grace the Duke of Sutherland
be most effectually met in this matter, so that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_443' name='page_443'></a>443</span>
cause of toleration and freedom of conscience may be maintained
in the extensive district which God, in His providence,
has consigned to his stewardship? We shall in
our next chapter attempt giving the question an answer.
Meanwhile, we trust the people of Sutherland will continue,
as hitherto, to stand firm. The strong repugnance which
they feel against being driven into churches which all their
better ministers have left, is not ill founded. No Church
of God ever employs such means of conversion as those
employed by his Grace: they are means which have been
often resorted to for the purpose of making men worse,
never yet for the purpose of making them better. We know
that, with their long-formed church-going habits, the people
must feel their now silent Sabbaths pass heavily; but they
would perhaps do well to remember, amid the tedium and
the gloom, that there were good men who not only anticipated
such a time of trial for this country, but who also
made provision for it. Thomas Scott, when engaged in
writing his Commentary, used to solace himself with the
belief that it might be of use at a period when the public
worship of God would be no longer tolerated in the land.
To the great bulk of the people of Sutherland that time
seems to have already come. They know, however, the
value of the old divines, and have not a few of their more
practical treatises translated into their own expressive
tongue: Alleine&#8217;s <i>Alarm</i>, Boston&#8217;s <i>Fourfold State</i>, Doddridge&#8217;s
<i>Rise and Progress</i>, Baxter&#8217;s <i>Call</i>, Guthrie&#8217;s <i>Saving
Interest</i>. Let these, and such as these, be their preachers,
when they can procure no other. The more they learn to
relish them, the less will they relish the bald and miserable
services of the Residuary Church. Let them hold their
fellowship and prayer meetings; let them keep up the
worship of God in their families; the cause of religious
freedom in the district is involved in the stand which they
make. Above all, let them possess their souls in patience.

We are not unacquainted with the Celtic character, as developed
in the Highlands of Scotland. Highlanders, up
to a certain point, are the most docile, patient, enduring of
men; but that point once passed, endurance ceases, and
the all too gentle lamb starts up an angry lion. The spirit
is stirred that maddens at the sight of the naked weapon,
and that, in its headlong rush upon the enemy, discipline
can neither check nor control. Let our oppressed Highlanders
of Sutherland beware. They have suffered much;
but, so far as man is the agent, their battles can be fought
on only the arena of public opinion, and on that ground
which the political field may be soon found to furnish.
Any explosion of violence on their part would be ruin to
both the Free Church and themselves.

<h3 style="margin-top:3em">CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<p>How is the battle of religious freedom to be best fought in
behalf of the oppressed people of Sutherland? We shall
attempt throwing out a few simple suggestions on the subject,
which, if in the right track, the reader may find it easy
to follow up and mature.</p>
<p>First, then, let us remember that in this country, in
which opinion is all-potent, and which for at least a century
and a half has been the envy of continental states for the
degree of religious freedom which it enjoys, the policy of
the Duke of Sutherland cannot be known without being
condemned. The current which he opposes has been
scooping out its channel for ages. Every great mind produced
by Britain, from the times of Milton and Locke
down to the times of Mackintosh and of Chalmers, has
been giving it impetus in but one direction; and it is scarce
likely that it will reverse its course now, at the bidding of
a few intolerant and narrow-minded aristocrats. British
opinion has but to be fairly appealed to, in order to declare
strongly in favour of the oppressed Highlanders of Sutherland.
What we would first remark, then, is, that the policy
of his Grace the Duke cannot be too widely exposed. The
press and the platform must be employed. The frank and
generous English must be told, that that law of religious
toleration which did so much at a comparatively early
period to elevate the character of their country in the eye
of the world, and which, in these latter times, men have
been accustomed to regard as somewhat less, after all, than
an adequate embodiment of the rights of conscience, has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_446' name='page_446'></a>446</span>
been virtually repealed in a populous and very extensive
district of the British empire, through a capricious exercise
of power on the part of a single man. Why, it has been
asked, in a matter which lies between God and conscience,
and between God and the conscience only, should a third
party be permitted to interfere so far as even to say, &#8216;I
tolerate you? I tolerate your Independency&ndash;&ndash;your Episcopacy&ndash;&ndash;your
Presbyterianism: you are a Baptist, but I
tolerate you?&#8217; There is an insult implied, it has been said,
in the way in which the liberty purports to be granted. It
bestows as a boon what already exists as a right. We
want no despot to tell us that he gives us leave to breathe
the free air of heaven, or that he permits us to worship
God <ins class="trchange" title="Was 'agreebly'">agreeably</ins> to the dictates of our conscience. Such are
the views with which a majority of the British people regard,
in these latter times, the right to tolerate; and regarding
a <i>right</i> <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>NOT</span> to tolerate, they must be more decided still.
The Free Church, then, must lay her complaint before
them. She must tell them, that such is the oppression to
which her people are subjected, that she would be but too
happy to see even the beggarly elements of the question recognised
in their behalf; that she would be but too happy
to hear the despot of a province pronounce the deprecated
&#8216;I tolerate you,&#8217; seeing that his virtual enunciation at present
is, &#8216;I do NOT tolerate you,&#8217; and seeing that he is
powerful enough, through a misapplication of his rights
and influence as the most extensive of British proprietors,
to give terrible effect to the unjust and illiberal determination.
The Free Church, on this question, must raise her
appeal everywhere to public opinion, and we entertain no
doubt that she will everywhere find it her friend.</p>
<p>But how is its power to be directed? How bring it to
bear upon the Duke of Sutherland? It is an all-potent
lever, but it must be furnished with a fulcrum on which to
rest, and a direction in which to bear. Let us remark,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_447' name='page_447'></a>447</span>
first, that no signal privilege or right was ever yet achieved
for Britain, that was not preceded by some signal wrong.
From the times of Magna Charta down to the times of the
Revolution, we find every triumph of liberty heralded in by
some gross outrage upon it. The history of the British
Constitution is a history of great natural rights established
piecemeal under the immediate promptings of an indignation
elicited by unbearable wrongs. It was not until the
barrier that protected the privileges of the citizen from the
will of the despot gave way at some weak point, that the
parties exposed to the inundation were roused up to re-erect
it on a better principle and a surer foundation. Now,
the Duke of Sutherland (with some of his brother proprietors)
has just succeeded in showing us a signal flaw in our
scheme of religious toleration, and this at an exceedingly
critical time. He has been perpetrating a great and palpable
wrong, which, if rightly represented, must have the
effect of leading men, in exactly the old mode, to arouse
themselves in behalf of the corresponding right. If a
single proprietor can virtually do what the sovereign of
Great Britain would forfeit the crown for barely attempting
to do&ndash;&ndash;if a single nobleman can do what the House of
Lords in its aggregate capacity would peril its very existence
for but proposing to do&ndash;&ndash;then does there exist in the
British Constitution a palpable flaw, which cannot be too
soon remedied. There must be a weak place in the barrier,
if the waters be rushing out; and it cannot be too
soon rebuilt on a surer plan. Here, then, evidently, is the
point on which the generated opinion ought to be brought
to bear. It has as its proper arena the political field. It
is a defect in the British Constitution, strongly exemplified
by the case of Sutherland, that the rights of property may
be so stretched as to overbear the rights of conscience&ndash;&ndash;that
though toleration be the law of the land generally, it
may be so set aside by the country&#8217;s proprietary, as not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_448' name='page_448'></a>448</span>
be the law in any particular part of it; and to reverse this
state of things&ndash;&ndash;to make provision in the Constitution that
the rights of the proprietor be not so overstretched, and
that a virtual repeal of the toleration laws in any part of
the country be not possible&ndash;&ndash;are palpably the objects to
which the public mind should be directed.</p>
<p>We have said that the Duke of Sutherland has succeeded
in showing us this flaw in the Constitution at a
peculiarly critical time. A gentleman resident in England,
for whose judgment we entertain the highest respect, told
us only a few days since, that the rising, all-absorbing party
of that kingdom, so far at least as the Established Church
and the aristocracy are concerned, still continues to be the
Puseyite party. If Puseyism does not bid fair to possess
a majority of the people of the country, it bids fair at least
to possess a majority of its acres. And we need scarce
remind the reader how peculiarly this may be the case with
Scotland, whose acres, in such large proportions, are under
the control of an incipient Puseyism already. In both
countries, therefore, is it of peculiar importance, in a time
like the present, that the law of toleration should be placed
beyond the control of a hostile or illiberal proprietary&ndash;&ndash;so
placed beyond their control, that they may be as unable
virtually to suspend its operation in any part of the country,
as they already are to suspend its operation in the whole of
the country. We are recommending, be it remembered, no
wild scheme of Chartist aggression on the rights of property&ndash;&ndash;we
would but injure our cause by doing so: our
strength in this question must altogether depend on the
soundness of the appeal which we can carry to the natural
justice of the community. We merely recommend that that
be done in behalf of the already recognised law of toleration,
which Parliament has no hesitation in doing in behalf of
some railway or canal, or water or dock company, when,
for what is deemed a public good, it sets aside the absolute
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_449' name='page_449'></a>449</span>
control of the proprietor over at least a portion of his property,
and consigns it at a fair price to the corporation
engaged in the undertaking. The principle of the scheme
is already recognised by the Constitution, and its legislative
embodiment would be at once easy and safe. Property
would be rendered not less, but more secure, if, in every
instance in which a regularly-organized congregation of any
denomination of Christians to which the law of toleration
itself extended, made application for ground on which to
erect a place of worship, the application would be backed
and made effectual, in virtue of an enacted law, by the
authority of the Constitution. There is no Scotch or English
Dissenter&ndash;&ndash;no true friend of religious liberty in Britain
or Ireland&ndash;&ndash;who would not make common cause with the
Free Church in urging a measure of this character on Parliament,
when fairly convinced, by cases such as that of
Sutherland, how imperatively such a measure is required.</p>
<p>Unavoidably, however, from the nature of things, the
relief which ultimately may be thus secured cannot be other
than distant relief. Much information must first be spread,
and the press and the platform extensively employed. Can
there be nothing done for Sutherland through an already
existing political agency? We are of opinion there can.
Sutherland itself is even more thoroughly a <i>close</i> county
now, than it was ere the Reform Bill had swamped the
paper votes, and swept away the close burghs. His Grace
the Duke has but to nominate his member, and his member
is straightway returned. But all the political power which,
directly or indirectly, his Grace possesses, is not equally
secure. Sutherland is a close county; but the Northern
Burghs are not rotten burghs; on the contrary, they possess
an independent and intelligent constituency; and in scarce
any part of Scotland is the Free Church equally strong.
And his Grace derives no inconsiderable portion of his
political influence from them. The member for Sutherland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_450' name='page_450'></a>450</span>
is virtually his Grace&#8217;s nominee, but the member for the
Northern Burghs is not his Grace&#8217;s nominee at all; and yet
certain it is that the gentleman by whom these burghs are
at present represented in Parliament is his Grace&#8217;s agent
and adviser in all that pertains to the management of
Sutherland, and has been so for many years. His Grace&#8217;s
member for Sutherland sits in Parliament in virtue of being
his Grace&#8217;s nominee; but the sort of prime minister through
which his Grace governs his princely domains, sits in Parliament,
not in virtue of being his Grace&#8217;s nominee, but in
virtue of his being himself a man of liberal opinions, and
an enemy to all intolerance. He represents them in the
Whig interest, and in his character as a Whig. His Grace
would very soon have one member less in Parliament, did
that member make common cause with his Grace in suppressing
the Free Church in Sutherland. Now, the bruit
shrewdly goeth, that that member does make common cause
with his Grace. The bruit shrewdly goeth, that in this, as
in most other matters, his Grace acts upon that member&#8217;s
advice. True, the report may be altogether idle&ndash;&ndash;it may be
utterly without foundation; instead of being true, it may be
exactly the reverse of being true; but most unquestionable
it is, that, whether true or otherwise, it exists, and that
that member&#8217;s constituency have a very direct interest in it.
He represents them miserably ill, and must be a very different
sort of Whig from them, if he hold that proprietors
do right in virtually setting aside the Toleration Act. The
report does one of two things,&ndash;&ndash;it either does him great injustice,
or it shows that he has sat too long in Parliament
for the Northern Burghs. It is in the power, then, of the
highly respectable and intelligent Whig constituency of this
district to make such a diversion in favour of the oppressed
people of Sutherland, as can scarce fail to tell upon the
country, and this in thorough consistency with the best and
highest principles of their party. Let them put themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_451' name='page_451'></a>451</span>
in instant communication with their member, and, stating
the character of the report which so generally exists to his
prejudice, request a categorical answer regarding it,&ndash;&ndash;let
them request an avowal of his opinion of the Duke&#8217;s policy,
equally articulate with that opinion which the Hon. Mr.
Fox Maule submitted to the public a few weeks ago in the
columns of the <i>Witness</i>,&ndash;&ndash;and then, as the ascertained
circumstances of the case may direct, let them act, and that
publicly, in strict accordance with their principles. Of one
thing they may be assured,&ndash;&ndash;the example will tell.</p>
<p>In order to raise the necessary amount of opinion for
carrying the ulterior object&ndash;&ndash;the enactment of a law&ndash;&ndash;there
are various most justifiable expedients to which the friends
of toleration in the country should find it not difficult to
resort. Petitions addressed to the Lower House in its
legislative capacity, and to the members of the Upper
House as a body of men who have, perhaps, of all others
the most direct stake in the matter&ndash;&ndash;we need scarce say
how&ndash;&ndash;ought, of course, to take a very obvious place on the
list. Much, too, might be done by deputations from the
General Assembly of the Free Church, instructed from time
to time to ascertain, and then publicly to report on, the
state of Sutherland. Each meeting of the Assembly might
be addressed on the subject by some of its ablest men, in
which case their statements and speeches would go forth,
through the medium of the press, to the country at large.
The co-operation and assistance of all bodies of evangelical
Dissenters, both at home and abroad, should be sedulously
sought after, and correct information on the subject circulated
among them extensively. There has been much
sympathy elicited for the Church, during her long struggle,
among good men everywhere. Her cause has been tried,
and judgment given in her favour, in France, Holland, and
America, and in not a few of the colonies. In the case of
Sismondi &#8216;On the <i>Clearing</i> of Sutherland,&#8217; we see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_452' name='page_452'></a>452</span>
opinion of a continental philosopher re-echoed back upon
our own country, not without its marked effect; and it
might be well to try whether the effect of foreign opinion
might not be at least equally influential &#8216;On the Suppression
of the Toleration Laws in Sutherland.&#8217; There is one
great country with which we hold our literature in common,
and which we can address, and by which we can be in turn
addressed, in our native tongue. Unluckily, what ought to
have existed as a bond of union and amity has been made
to subserve a very different purpose; and we cannot conceal
from ourselves the fact, that our own country has been
mainly to blame. The manners, habits, and tastes of the
Americans have been exhibited, by not a few of our popular
writers, in the broadest style of caricature; they have been
described as a nation of unprincipled speculators, devoid
not only of right feeling, but even of common honesty, and
remarkable for but their scoundrelism and conceit. Even
were such descriptions just, which they are not, most
assuredly would they be unwise. It is the American
people, rather than the American government, who make
peace and war; and the first American war with England
will be one of the most formidable in which this country
has yet been engaged. The bowie-knife is no trifling
weapon; and the English writer laughs at a very considerable
expense, if his satires have the effect of whetting it.
At present, however, the war between the two countries is
but a war of libel and pasquinade, and the advantage
hitherto has been on the side of the aggressor. America
has not been happy in her retaliation. We would fain
direct her to aim where her darts, instead of provoking
national hostility, or exciting a bitter spirit among the
entire people of a country, would but subserve the general
cause of liberty and human improvement. It is but idle to
satirize our manners and customs; we think them good.
There is nothing to be gained by casting ridicule on our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_453' name='page_453'></a>453</span>
peculiar modes of thinking; they are the modes to which
we have been accustomed, and we prefer them to any
others. But there are matters of a different kind, regarding
which the country bears a conscience, and is not quite at
its ease; and there we are vulnerable. We speak often,
we would fain say, of slavery in your country, literati of
America, and justly deem it a great evil. It might do us
good were you to remind us, in turn, that there are extensive
districts in our own, in which virtually there exists no
toleration law for the religion of the people, though that
religion be Protestantism in its purest form. Cast your
eyes upon the county of Sutherland.</p>

Some of the reasonings of both the Established and Free Church
courts on this matter would be amusing were they not so sad. &#8216;Feed
my lambs,&#8217; said our Saviour, after His resurrection, to Peter; and again
twice over, &#8216;Feed my sheep.&#8217; Now, let us suppose some zealous
clergyman setting himself, on the strength of the latter injunction here,
to institute a new order of preachers. As barbers frequently amuse
their employers with gossip, when divesting them of their beards or
trimming their heads, and have opportunities of addressing their fellow-men
which are not possessed by the other mechanical professions, the
zealous clergyman determines on converting them into preachers, and
sets up a Normal School, in order that they may be taught the art of
composing short sermons, which they are to deliver when shaving their
customers, and longer ones, which they are to address to them when
cutting their hair. And in course of time the expounding barbers are
sent abroad to operate on the minds and chins of the community.
&#8216;There is no mention made of any such order of prelectors,&#8217; says a
stubborn layman, &#8216;in my New Testament;&#8217; &#8216;Nor yet in mine,&#8217; says
another. &#8216;Sheer Atheism,&ndash;&ndash;Deism at the very least!&#8217; exclaims the
zealous clergyman. &#8216;Until Christianity was fairly established in the
world, there was no such thing as shaving at all; the Jews don&#8217;t shave
yet: besides, does not every decent Church member shave before going
to church? And as for the authority, how read you the text, &#8220;Feed
my sheep!&#8217;&#8221; &#8216;Weighty argument that about the shaving,&#8217; say the
laymen; &#8216;but really the text seems to be stretched just a little too far.
The commission is given to Peter; but it confers on Peter no authority
whatever to commission the barbers. Nay, our grand objection to the
pseudo-successors of Peter is, that they corrupted the Church after this
very manner, by commissioning the non-commissioned, until they
filled the groaning land with cardinals, bishops, and abbots, monks and
nuns,&ndash;&ndash;
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
&#8220;Eremites and friars,<br />
White, black, and grey, with all their trumpery.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>

<p>
Now, be it remembered that we are far from placing the Church-employed
schoolmaster on the level of the parson-employed barber of
our illustration. <i>Rationally</i> considered, they are very different orders
indeed; but so far as <i>direct</i> Scripture is concerned, they stand, we contend,
on exactly the same ground. The laity would do well in this
controversy to arm themselves with the New Testament, and, if their
opponents be very intolerant, to hand them the volume, and request
them to turn up their authority. And, of course, if the intolerance be
very great, the authority must be very direct. Mere arguings on the
subject would but serve to show that it has no actual existence. When
the commission of a captain or lieutenant is legitimately demanded, it
is at once produced; but were one to demand the commission of a
sergeant or boatswain&#8217;s mate, the man could at best only reason
about it.

<p>
This passage has been referred to in several Free Church presbyteries,
as if the writer had affirmed that the schoolmaster stands on no
higher level than the shoemaker or tailor. We need scarce say, however,
that the passage conveys no such meaning. By affirming that
in matters of chimney-sweeping men choose for themselves the best
chimney-sweeps, and in matters of indisposition or disease the best
physicians, we do not at all level the physician with the chimney-sweep:
we merely intimate that there is a <i>best</i> in both professions, and that men
select that best, as preferable to what is inferior or worse, on every
occasion they can.

&#8216;The sixth resolution [of the Educational Manifesto], in which the
opinion of Dr. Chalmers is quoted, that Government [should] abstain
from introducing the element of religion at all into their part of the
scheme, must, as here introduced, be presumed to mean, that in the
Act of the Legislature which shall carry the views of the resolutionists
into practical effect, nothing shall be said about religious instruction;
but that power shall be given to the heads of families to manage the
schools, and prescribe the subjects to be taught, according to their own
convictions of what is sound in religious and useful in secular instruction.
But this would leave the religious rights of the minority completely
unprotected. Government must do something more than <i>omit</i>
the religious element: it must limit the power of the majority to introduce
this element into their schools to the injury of the minority.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Letter

The following portion of a motion on the educational question,
announced in the Edinburgh Presbytery of the Free Church on the 6th
of February last, is specially referred to in this paragraph:&ndash;&ndash;
</p><p>
&#8216;That the successful working of the present Government plan would
be greatly promoted by the following amendments:&ndash;&ndash;
</p><p>
&#8216;1<i>st</i>, The entire omission in all cases (except, perhaps, the case of
the Established Church) of the certificate regarding religious instruction,
and the recognition of all bodies, whether Churches or private
parties and associations, as equally entitled to receive aid.
</p><p>
&#8216;2<i>d</i>, The adoption of a rule in proportioning Government grants to
local efforts more flexible, and admitting of far more liberal aid in destitute
localities, as compared with those which are in a better condition.
</p><p>
&#8216;3<i>d</i>, The institution, on the part of Government, of an inquiry into
the destitution confessedly existing in large towns, populous neighbourhoods,
and remote districts, with a view of marking out places where
elementary schools are particularly needed; and the holding out of
special encouragement to whatever parties may come forward as willing
to plant such schools.
</p><p>
&#8216;That the preceding suggestions, if adopted, would go far to render
the present Government plan unobjectionable in principle, and also to
fit it in practice for ascertaining the educational wants of the country;
but that a much more liberal expenditure of the public money would
seem to be indispensable, as well as a less stringent application, upon
adequate cause shown, of the rules by which the expenditure is
regulated.&#8217;
</p><p>
In bringing the motion forward in the following meeting of Presbytery,
the clause recommending the &#8216;entire omission in all cases of the
certificate regarding religious instruction&#8217; was suffered to drop.

Such are the proportions laid down in the official document for
Scotland of the Committee of Her Majesty&#8217;s Privy Council on Education.

possess certain modifying powers, through which the Government
grant is occasionally extended to deserving teachers whose salary and
fees united fall considerably short of the specified sum of forty-five

&#8216;I see,&#8217; said Knox, when the Privy Council, in dividing the ecclesiastical
revenues of the kingdom into three parts, determined on giving
two of these to the nobility, and on dividing the remaining part between
the Protestant ministry and the Court,&ndash;&ndash;&#8217; I see two-thirds freely
given to the devil, and the other third divided between God and the
devil: if the end of this order be happy, my judgment fails me!&#8217; Our
church courts, if they declare for the system of denominational grants,
in opposition to the territorial endowments of a scheme truly national,
will be securing virtually a similar division of the people, with but this
difference, that God&#8217;s share of the reserved moiety may be a very small
share indeed. And can it possibly be held that the shame and guilt
of such an arrangement can be obviated by the votes of Synods or
Assemblies? or that, with an intelligent laity to judge in the matter,
the &#8216;end of this order&#8217; can be other than unhappy? The schools of
the Free Church have already, it is said, done much good. We would,
we reply, be without excuse, in taking up our present position&ndash;&ndash;a position
in which we have painfully to differ from so many of the friends
in whose behalf for the last ten years we deemed it at once a privilege
and an honour to contend&ndash;&ndash;did we believe that more than six hundred
Protestant schools <i>could</i> exist in Scotland without doing <i>much</i> good.
Of nothing, however, are we more convinced, than that the good which
they have done has been accomplished by them in their character as
<i>schools</i>, not in their character as <i>denominational</i>. We know a little
regarding this matter; for in our journeyings of many thousand miles
over Scotland, especially in the Highlands and the northern counties,
we have made some use of both our eyes and ears. We have seen,
and sickened to see, hordes of schoolboys of ten and twelve years
bandying as nicknames, with boys whose parents belonged to the
Establishment, the terms of polemic controversy. &#8216;Moderate&#8217; has
become in juvenile mouths as much a term of hatred and reproach in
extensive districts of our country, as we remember &#8216;Frenchman&#8217; used
to be during the great revolutionary war. Our children bid fair to
get, in their state of denominational separatism, at least religion enough
heartily to hate their neighbours; and, we are afraid, not much more.
Now, it may be thought that the Editor of the <i>Witness</i>, himself long
engaged in semi-theological warfare, ought to be silent in a matter of
this kind. Be it remembered, we reply, that it was <i>men</i>, not children,
whom the Editor of the <i>Witness</i> made it his business to address; and
that when, in what he deemed a good cause, he appealed to the understandings
of his adult country-folk, he besought them in every instance
to test and examine ere they judged and decided. He did not contemplate
a phase of the controversy in which unthinking children should
come from their schools to contend with other children, in the spirit of
those little ones of Bethel who &#8216;came forth out of their city&#8217; to mock
and to jeer; or that immature, unreasoning minds should be torn by
the she-bears of uncharitable feeling, at an age when the points really
at issue in the case can be received only as prejudices, and expressed
only by the mere calling of names. And seeing and knowing what he
has seen and knows, he has become sincerely desirous that controversy
should be left to at least the adult population of the country, and that
its children of all the communions should be sent to mingle together in
their games and their tasks, and to form their unselfish attachments,
under a wise system of national tuition, as thoroughly Christian as may
be, but at the same time as little as possible polemical or sectarian.

&#8216;We are aware,&#8217; says a respected antagonist, &#8216;that Mr. Miller is no
Deist; his argument, nevertheless, rests on a deistical position,&ndash;&ndash;a
charge to which Dr. Chalmers&#8217; letter is not liable to be exposed, in
consequence of its first sentence, and of what it recommends in a
Government preamble.&#8217; If there be such virtue in a preamble, say we,
let us by all means have a preamble&ndash;&ndash;ten preambles if necessary&ndash;&ndash;rather
than a deistic principle. We would fain imitate in this matter
the tolerance of Luther. &#8216;A complaint comes that such and such a
reformed preacher will not preach without a cassock. &#8220;Well,&#8221;
answers Luther, &#8220;what harm will a cassock do the man? Let him
have a cassock to preach in; let him have three cassocks, if he find
benefit in them.&#8217;&#8221;

<p>
It is not uninstructive to remark how invariably in this matter an
important point has been taken for granted which has not yet been
proven; and how the most serious charges have been preferred against
men&#8217;s principles, on the assumption that there exists in the question a
certain divine truth, which may be neither divine nor yet a truth at all.
Wisdom and goodness may be exhibited in both the negative and positive
form&ndash;&ndash;both by avoiding what is wicked and foolish, and by doing
what is good and wise. And while no Christian doubts that the adorable
Head of the Church manifested His character, when on earth, in
both ways, at least no Presbyterian doubts that He manifested it not
only by instituting certain orders in His Church, but also by omitting
to institute in it certain other orders. He instituted, for instance, an
order of preachers of the gospel; He did not institute an order of popes
and cardinals. Neither, however, did He institute an order of &#8216;religion-teaching&#8217;
schoolmasters; and the question not yet settled, and
of which, without compromising a single article in our standards,
either side may be espoused, is, whether our Saviour manifested His
wisdom in <i>not</i> making use of the schoolmaster, or whether, without
indicating His mind on the subject, He left the schoolmaster to be
legitimately employed in an after-development of the Church.
</p><p>
Indeed, so entirely in this matter is the Free Church at sea, without
chart or compass, that it has still to be determined whether the
religious teaching of her schools be of a tendency to add to or to
diminish the religious feeling of the country. &#8216;I sometimes regretted
to observe,&#8217; says Dr. Reid, in his Report on the Schools in connection
with the Free Presbytery of Edinburgh, &#8216;that [their lessons in the Bible
and Shorter Catechism] were taught rather too much in the style of the
ordinary lessons. I do not object to <i>places being taken</i>, or any other
means employed, which a teacher may consider necessary to secure
attention during a Scripture lesson; but divine truth should always be
communicated with solemnity.&#8217; Now, such is the general defect of the
religious teaching of the schoolroom. Nor is it to be obviated, we
fear, by any expression of extra solemnity thrown into the pedagogical
face, or even by the <i>taking of places</i> or the <i>taws</i>. And there seems
reason to dread that lessons of this character can have but the effect of
commonplacing the great truths of religion in the mind, and hardening
the heart against their after application from the pulpit. But some ten
or twelve years will serve to unveil to the Free Church the real nature of
the experiment in which she is now engaged. For our own part, we can
have little doubt, be the matter decided as it may, that experience will
serve ultimately to show how vast the inferiority really is of man&#8217;s
&#8216;teachers of religion&#8217; to Christ&#8217;s preachers of the gospel.
</p><p>
We shall never forget at least the more prominent particulars of a
conversation on this subject which we were privileged to hold with one
of the most original-minded clergymen (now, alas, no more) our Church
ever produced. He referred, first, to the false association which those
words of world-wide meaning, &#8216;religious education,&#8217; are almost sure to
induce, when restricted, in a narrow, inadequate sense, to the teaching
of the schoolmaster; and next, to the divine commission of the minister
of the gospel. &#8216;Perverted as human nature is,&#8217; he remarked, &#8216;there
are cases in which, by appealing to its sentiments and affections, we
may derive a very nice evidence respecting the divine origin of certain
institutions and injunctions. For instance, the Chinese hold, as one of
their religious beliefs, that parents have a paramount claim to the affections
of their sons and daughters, long after they have been married and
settled in the world; whereas our Saviour teaches that a man should
leave father and mother and cleave to his wife, and the wife leave
father and mother and cleave to her husband. And as, in the case of
the dead and living child, Solomon sought his evidence in the feelings
of the women that came before him, and determined <i>her</i> to be the true
mother in whom he found the true mother&#8217;s love and regard, I would
seek my evidence, in this other case, in the affections of human nature;
and ask them whether they declared for the law of the Chinese Baal,
or for that of Him who implanted them in the heart. And how prompt
and satisfactory the reply! The love which of twain makes one flesh
approves itself, in all experience, to be greatly stronger and more engrossing
than that which attaches the child to the parent; and while we
see the unnatural Chinese law making the weaker traverse and overrule
the stronger affection, and thus demonstrating its own falsity, we find
the law of Christ exquisitely concerting with the nature which Christ
gave, and thus establishing its own truth. Now, regarding the commission
of the minister of the gospel,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;I put a similar
question to the affections, and receive from them a not less satisfactory
reply. The God who gave the commission does inspire a love for him
who truly bears it; ay, a love but even too engrossing at times, and
that, by running to excess, defeats its proper end, by making the servant
eclipse in the congregational mind the Master whose message he bears.
But I do believe that the sentiment, like the order to which it attaches,
is, in its own proper place, of divine appointment. It is a preparation
for the reception in love of the gospel message. God does not will that
His message should be injured by any prejudice against the bearer of
it; and that His will in this matter might be adequately carried out,
was one of the grand objects of our contendings in the Church controversy.
But we are not to calculate on the existence of any such strong
feeling of love between the children of a school and their teacher. If,
founding on the experience of our own early years, we think of the
schoolmaster, not in his present relation to ourselves as a fellow-citizen,
or as a servant of the Church, but simply in his connection with the
immature class on which he operates, we will find him circled round in
their estimation (save in perhaps a very few exceptional cases) with
greatly more of terror than affection. There are no two classes of feelings
in human nature more diverse than the class with which the schoolmaster
and the class with which the minister of the gospel is regarded
by their respective charges; and right well was St. Paul aware of the
fact, when he sought in the terrors of the schoolmaster an illustration of
the terrors of the law. And in this fence of terror we may perhaps find
a reason why Christ never committed to the schoolmaster the gospel
message.&#8217; We are afraid we do but little justice, in this passage, to the
thinking of our deceased friend; for we cannot recall his flowing and
singularly happy language, but we have, we trust, preserved his leading
ideas; and they are, we think, worthy of being carefully pondered.
We may add, that he was a man who had done much in his parish for
education; but that he had at length seen, though without relaxing his
efforts, that the religious teaching of his schools had failed to make the
rising generation under his charge religious, and had been led seriously
to inquire regarding the cause of its failure.

Mr. Combe, however, may be regarded as an extreme man; and
so the following letter, valuable as illustrating the views of a not very
extreme opponent, though a decided assertor of the non-religious system
of tuition, may be well deemed instructive. The writer, Mr. Samuel
Lucas, was for many years Chairman of that Lancashire Public School
Association which Mr. Fox proposes as the model of his scheme:&ndash;&ndash;
</p>
<p style="text-align:center; margin-top:1.5em">
TO THE EDITOR OF THE SCOTSMAN.
</p>
<p>
<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Sir</span>,&ndash;&ndash;In your paper of the 26th ultimo, I observe among the advertisements
a set of resolutions which have been agreed to and signed by
a number of parties, with the view of a national movement in favour of
an unsectarian system of national education. It is perhaps too early to
say, that though the names of some of the parties are well known and
highly esteemed in this country, yet that the names of many who might
be expected to be foremost in promoting such an object are wanting.
</p><p>
I cannot, however, help thinking, that some of these may have been
prevented from signing the document in question by some considerations
which have occurred to myself on the perusal of it; and as a few
lines of editorial comment indicate that the project has your sanction,
you will perhaps allow me briefly to say why I think the people of
Scotland should give to it the most deliberate consideration before committing
themselves to it.
</p><p>
Agreeing, as I do most fully, with a large proportion of the contents of
the resolutions, I regret that its authors have made an attempt, which it
is impossible can be successful, to unite in the national schoolhouses, and
in the school hours, a sound religious with an unsectarian education.
</p><p>
What is a <i>sound religious education</i>? Will not the professors of every
variety of religious faith answer the question differently?
</p><p>
I think it was Bishop Berkeley who said, Orthodoxy is my doxy;
heterodoxy is another man&#8217;s doxy. So it is with a sound religious
education. What is sound to me is hollow and superficial, or perhaps
full of error, to another.
</p><p>
If it be said that the majority of heads of families must decide as to
what is sound and what is unsound, I must protest against such an
injustice. The minority will contribute to the support of the public
schools, and neither directly nor indirectly can they with justice be
deprived of the use of them.
</p><p>
It appears to me that the authors of the resolutions are flying in the
face of their own great authority, in proposing to introduce religious
instruction into the public schools. It is true that Dr. Chalmers proposes
that Government should &#8216;leave this matter entire to the parties
who had to do with the erection and management of the schools which
they had been called upon to assist;&#8217; but he was not then contemplating
the erection of national schools by the public money, but schools
erected by voluntary subscription, which the Government might be
called on to assist.
</p><p>
His opinion on the right action of Government in the present state of
things is clear. He says: &#8216;That in any public measure for helping on
the education of the people, Government [should] abstain from introducing
the element of religion at all into their part of the scheme.&#8217;
</p><p>
What, then, should be the course taken by the promoters of public
schools, in accordance with the principles enunciated by Dr Chalmers?
It appears to me to be clearly this: to make no provision whatever for,
or rather directly to exclude, all religious teaching within the walls of
the school, and to leave, in the words of the fifth resolution, &#8216;the duty
and responsibility of communicating religious instruction&#8217; in the hands
of those &#8216;to whom they have been committed by God, viz. to their
parents, and, through them, to such teachers as they may choose to
entrust with that duty.&#8217;
</p><p>
This was the course pursued by the Government of Holland in the
early part of the present century; and I suppose no one will venture to
call in question the morality or religion of the people of that country, or
to throw a doubt upon the success of the system.
</p><p>
It is as an ardent friend of National Education, both in Scotland and
England, that I have ventured to make these few observations. I desire
to throw no obstruction in the way of any movement calculated to attain
so desirable an object. It may be that I am mistaken in supposing that
it is intended to convey religious instruction, in the public schools, of a
kind that will be obnoxious to a minority; and if so, the design of the
authors of the resolutions will have no more sincere well-wisher than,
Sir, your obedient servant,

The Church as such ought to employ the schoolmaster, it has been
argued, in virtue of the divine injunction, &#8216;Search the Scriptures:&#8217;
what God <i>commands</i> men to do, it is her duty to <i>enable</i> men to do. The
argument is excellent, we say, so far as it goes; but of perilous application
in the case in hand. It is the Church&#8217;s duty to teach those to
read the Scriptures, who, <i>without her assistance, would not be taught to
read them</i>. But if by teaching Latin, arithmetic, algebra, and the
mathematics to <i>ten</i>, she is incapacitating herself from teaching <i>twenty</i> to
read the Bible; or if, by teaching twenty to read the Bible who would
have learned to read it whether she taught them or no, she is incapacitating
herself from teaching twenty others to read it, who, unless she
teach them, will never learn to read it at all; then, instead of doing her
recognised duty in the matter, she is doing exactly the reverse of her
duty&ndash;&ndash;doing what prevents her from doing her duty. Let the Free
Church but take her stand on this argument, and straightway her
rectors, her masters in academies, and her schoolmasters planted in
towns and populous localities, to teach the higher branches, become
so many bars raised by herself virtually to impede and arrest her,
through the expense incurred in their maintenance, in her proper work
of enabling the previously untaught and ignorant to read the word of
God, in obedience to the divine injunction.

This statement has been quoted by an antagonist as utterly inconsistent
with our general line of argument; but we think we may
safely leave the reader to determine whether it be really so. Did we
ever argue that any scheme of national education, however perfect,
could possibly supersede the proper <i>missionary</i> labours of the Churches,
whether educational or otherwise? Assuredly not. What we really
assert is, that if the Churches waste their energies on work not missionary,
the work which, if they do it not, cannot be done must of
necessity be neglected; seeing that, according to Bacon, &#8216;charity will
hardly water the ground where it must first fill a pool.&#8217;

&#8216;but as information communicated by men of honour, judgment,
and perfect veracity, descriptive of what they daily witness, affords the
best means of forming a correct judgment, and as these gentlemen, from
their situations in life, have no immediate interest in the determination

their authority may be considered as undoubted.&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>General Stewart</span>
